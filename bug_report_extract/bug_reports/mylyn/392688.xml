    <thetext>TaskAttribute does not appear to currently support the notion of &quot;unset&quot;. Note that this value is different from empty string. It is also more subtly different from &quot;null&quot;, although null is often used to tacitly distinguish a value that has been explicitly (e.g. by user action) set rather than never touched by the user. But because TaskAttributes only supports strings for the getter, we can&apos;t do that either. We could fake it with some sort of magic value, but that&apos;s a questionable approach.

(The immediate driver for this is support for EMF models mapped to TaskData -- without this notion we end up needing to trap for bad values that should never be written back in first place. We can probably find another work around within the TaskSchema implementation, but it would be nice to have this in framework I think.)</thetext>

    <thetext>See: https://git.eclipse.org/r/8351

I realized that simply checking for getValues() size == 0 can give you unset state, but I think it should be explicit. Not sure if we want unset() method or not, as it would be more clear but would simply shadow clearValues().</thetext>
