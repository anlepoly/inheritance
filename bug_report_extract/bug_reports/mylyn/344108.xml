    <thetext>The reply button on review comments doesn&apos;t work. I think this should open the post comments dialog and prefill with comment with a quoted version of the comment in question.</thetext>

    <thetext>Correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but it appears to be the case that the only way global commenting is supported now is through publish comment. I&apos;d like to go ahead and add a New Comment box to the task editor as well, unless anyone objects..</thetext>

    <thetext>Hmm... this begs the question of whether we want a global &quot;Review&quot; or &quot;Submit&quot; action (and Actions section?) that would trigger publishing of the comments dialog (and any draft comments..?) If we don&apos;t support this, the Reply to Functionality doesn&apos;t really make sense either, as we don&apos;t have any where to put the replied comment or to trigger it&apos;s being submitted. (We could just take the value and put it in the publish comments dialog, which is what I&apos;ll do for a first pass, but that workflow is pretty weird / nonintuitive.</thetext>

    <thetext>This is directly related to bug 370645. Gerrit would need to integrate with the standard editor submit functionality and provide a comment attribute as proposed in the review. At least the publish action would need to be triggered through the editor to support this (which may be a reasonable effort overall).</thetext>

    <thetext>Right, on submit button, I was thinking we could just provide the PublishCommentDialog. As a variation, we could assume that the comment was what they wanted, and provide a simple confirm dialog. I&apos;d like to do away with the confirm altogether, but I gather that isn&apos;t easy to do under the current design..we would also miss the &quot;opportunity&quot; to inform user of number of drafts, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s neccessary and isn&apos;t provided w. Gerrit Web Ui in any case. Thoughts? Worth doing for this bug or should we hold on it?</thetext>

    <thetext>We should remove the confirmation dialog. Currently it supports voting which would need to be integrated with the editor first. It&apos;s also possible to publish comments for older patch sets which is something we should support as well. I would propose to polish the current review, merge it and track all further improvements under bug 370645.</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #9)
&gt; We should remove the confirmation dialog.

I assume you mean &quot;eventually&quot; not &quot;now&quot; as part of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/9089/? (We can&apos;t do so now as as you point out below that would leave the user no way to vote.)

&gt; Currently it supports voting which
&gt; would need to be integrated with the editor first. It&apos;s also possible to
&gt; publish comments for older patch sets which is something we should support
&gt; as well. I would propose to polish the current review, merge it and track
&gt; all further improvements under bug 370645.

+1 So unless I misunderstood I&apos;m going to address the tow other things you noticed on the review and we can hopefully leave it at that for now.</thetext>
