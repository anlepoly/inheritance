    <thetext>In a workspace in a directory with a space in its name where I have only ever installed version 2.0.1.I20130712-2204 of Gerrit, when I query it creates a directory with the same path but with the space replaced with a %20 containing .metadata\.mylyn\reviews_bin. E.g. if my workspace path is C:\test eclipses\workspace1 I get a C:\test%20eclipses\workspace1 directory.</thetext>

    <thetext>That&apos;s not good. We need to fix the Ecore URL encoding. I thought we already had a test for this, but I guess not...</thetext>

    <thetext>Ok, I&apos;m able to reproduce, but only for the special case where the space is in the first level directory. If I do e.g. C:\Users\Miles Parker\blah it works as expected. That must have been the case that was already handled that I was thinking of.</thetext>

As I step through execution, this could also explain some other anomalies, as when we get the resource the code thinks it doesn&apos;t exist and we need to keep recreating the resource over and over. (EMF does *find* the resource in the correct place, it&apos;s the connector code that&apos;s getting the path right.) Note that you shouldn&apos;t actually have anything in that directory, and you *should* have a directory C:\test eclipses\workspace1\.metadata\.mylyn\reviews_bin that contains the files, correct?

Sam, do you often actually have this case where the first segment includes spaces?</thetext>

    <thetext>Note that I haven&apos;t thought of a really good way to test this *specific* case, because I don&apos;t think I can use a root directory for the tests and this only appears to happen on Windows which isn&apos;t unit tested anyway.</thetext>

    <thetext>Ok, I&apos;ve put it under testing now. On further investigation, this seems to happen regardless of where the spaces are in the path, and regardless of Operating System. I think it&apos;s also likely that this was the original cause for a number of recent bugs, including bug 413363 and bug 413362 and might explain why some issues seemed reproducible and others didn&apos;t.

Nice find, Sam. Thanks!</thetext>

&gt; Sam, do you often actually have this case where the first segment includes
&gt; spaces?

I always have this case when testing by installing a build into eclipse. I don&apos;t have this case in my normal development and testing workspaces.</thetext>
