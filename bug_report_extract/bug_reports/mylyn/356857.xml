    <thetext>The buttons used in the R4E properties view e.g. ADD/REMOVE Components, participants, etc... are placed to the far right, 
and are not completely visible in many cases.  if the view is re-sized to make them visible, the actual internal width is enlarged making them go even further so the use of the horizontal scroll becomes necessary. 
  It seems the intention is to make them available within the visible window of the view, but this is not working.</thetext>

This is a problem that is related to resizing a table column within a table composite that is located in a tabbed property view.  It seems that the table and its parent composite keeps growing even if the workbench window is shrinked.  

A possible workaround is to set the column width to a fixed size, but that has other disadvantages. 

For now, I improved the behavior a bit.  This will have to be addressed eventually.  But, as agreed to the team, and given our time constraints, this will be put in the back burner for now.</thetext>
