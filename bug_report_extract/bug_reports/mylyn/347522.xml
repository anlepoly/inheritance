    <thetext>As the number of reviews increases, it is necessary to hide the ones no longer relevant.
For example the combination of the following two filters shall be the preference for the majority of the users:

 * Show my Reviews
 * Hide completed reviews
 
 The above will show the active reviews where a participant is involved.
And if the user wants to see only the active ones that he has not marked reviewed he can further refine it with
* Hide Reviewed elements

The three filters above will display the user&apos;s backlog which can actually be triggered by a single action which can active these three filters.</thetext>

The problem here is that we need to open a review to see if it is completed.  Since only the current review is open at any given time, it is not trivial to do this.</thetext>

A possible solution to this would be to maintain a list of completed reviews at the Review Group level.  At R4E startup we can open all review groups and cache that list in the UI model, so that it is available at filtering time.  We will need to update that list every time a review is completed.  This will require changes in the UI and core component.</thetext>

&gt; Any pending items ?

The hide completed reviews filter is implemented, including default filter settings.  As for the combination of filters, this is the user&apos;s responsibility.

What we can do eventually is to provide the preferences values we think should be implemented by default as a separate .properties files.  This is lower priority and can be handled as a separate bug.  We also have to see since we have other bugs to remove preferences values as per Mylyn guidelines</thetext>
