It&apos;s done manually (based on the commit the build ran against).</thetext>

    <thetext>Sam, I assume you are going to handle IP log submission etc.? One thing to consider is that we can&apos;t accept non committer contributions after submitting the log (some bugs scheduled for the release are still assigned to non committer e.g. bug 428477, bug 423242, bug 421352).</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, but I may have questions since I&apos;ve never done it before. Some of those bugs will not be included in the release anyway since we have already done the RC - once we have 3.12 milestones in bugzilla they can be moved. When does the IP log need to be submitted?</thetext>

    <thetext>I think at least two weeks before the release but there are a number of other steps so starting a bit earlier is usually less stressful. This page has a bunch more details: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/HOWTO/Release_Cycle#Release_Review .

You can find the IP log here: http://www.eclipse.org/projects/ip_log.php?id=mylyn,mylyn.builds,mylyn.commons,mylyn.context,mylyn.docs,mylyn.reviews,mylyn.tasks,mylyn.versions
The automated check for the downloads area is here: http://eclipse.org/projects/tools/downloads.php?id=mylyn

There are a few red flags so you verify that all required CQs are in place. 

Bug 428132 is a release blocker so we need to rebuild for sure. I also noticed that the version in CoreUtil is still 3.10 and I&apos;m not sure that all repository labels reflect the supported repository versions. Did you update the help documentation from the Wiki already?</thetext>

Sounds like Guava is missing. I don&apos;t know what the easiest way to consume that is. You could probably get it from the Maven cache or something like that.</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen, it looks like I can&apos;t submit the IP log:

bq. You can submit an IP Log for review by Eclipse Legal only if you are a committer on all the projects in the log.

I guess we shouldn&apos;t need to do anything to assemble the log, but I don&apos;t see anything in there about https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7904 (add support for storing breakpoints in Mylyn&apos;s task context model).</thetext>

I can submit the log but it looks broken to me. There are a ton of commits from &quot;mkersten&quot; that weren&apos;t there when we submitted this last. I assume something changed in the foundation database which needs to be fixed before we can submit the log. Can you file a bug against community and CC Wayne?</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen, I would like to do another RC build tomorrow. Can you create e_4_4_m_3_11_x branches on the following repositories and commits? I&apos;ve done it for the others but I&apos;m not a committer on these:

builds - 58f306432160e9521cff82bf92ea2594c53ceade

versions - 4f804fa9031e3313fe56cfa364b044a630ca1e67

I am not sure how I should create the branch on the mylyn.all repository. David said I just needed to edit the .gitmodules file to point to the right branches and push it to a new branch, but that doesn&apos;t seem to be how it was done for previous releases. For those, it doeesn&apos;t specify a branch at all.</thetext>

We didn&apos;t have that automation in the past (it was a manual process to update the parent) so this will be the first time we do this.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks! Are you confident that that those fixes are low risk? Even though we&apos;re rebuilding, we should be careful about what we include; the idea was to have minimal changes after the first RC build.</thetext>

I&apos;m still seeing lots of mkersten (Mik) commits that weren&apos;t there before. It could be that Mik isn&apos;t properly listed as a committer in the foundation database (but only as a project lead). Wayne?

For the new commits I&apos;m wondering if the database is fully up to date since commits were merged recently (Feb 18): http://projects.eclipse.org/projects/mylyn.context/who .</thetext>

I made a change that&apos;s impacted how the contributions are generated. Unfortunately, it uncovered some errors in the database. I&apos;ll fix those.

In the meantime, I&apos;ve inserted a fix that should give us similar results as before.

&gt; For the new commits I&apos;m wondering if the database is fully up to date since
&gt; commits were merged recently (Feb 18):
&gt; http://projects.eclipse.org/projects/mylyn.context/who .

The database should be up-to-date. If you&apos;re seeing something that should/should-not be there, let me know.</thetext>

&gt; I am not sure how I should create the branch on the mylyn.all repository. David
&gt; said I just needed to edit the .gitmodules file to point to the right branches
&gt; and push it to a new branch, but that doesn&apos;t seem to be how it was done for
&gt; previous releases. For those, it doeesn&apos;t specify a branch at all.

I could not get this to automatically update the submodules so I updated them manually and pushed another commit so that I could start the build. David Slater says he was never able to get this to work using relative paths, so we may have to see if we can use absolute paths (ssh:// or git://) in .gitmodules.</thetext>

It seems like it is correctly updating the 3.11 branch on the parent (mylyn.all) repository with changes from the 3.11 branches on the child repositories, now. The problem was that upon creation of the parent branch, it didn&apos;t correctly update the submodules. Maybe in the future we should create and push the branch on the parent (including editing .gitmodules) before creating branches on the child repositories.</thetext>

&gt; I don&apos;t think the March 19 date is realistic any longer (and the M6 deadline
&gt; is today anyways so I don&apos;t think it matters if we move it by a week).

I have another project possibly pushing for a March 19 release. If you can give me PMC-approved materials by EOB today (or early tomorrow), I can schedule the review to end on that date. 

We&apos;ll be dependent on the IP Team to get the IP Log reviewed in time for the release (normally, I like to have their approval before I schedule, but we do make exceptions from time-to-time). I have no idea whether or not the IP Team can pull this off.

March 26 also works (I already have several other reviews on that date).

Let me know what you prefer.</thetext>

    <thetext>Sam, would it make sense to update versions to 3.12 in master? 

We should also tag the 3.11 release. Please let me know for which repositories I should push tags that you don&apos;t have write permission for. 

I have granted you permission to edit Bugzilla milestones/versions etc. for the following projects: Mylyn, Mylyn Commons, Mylyn Context, Mylyn Tasks. I think it makes sense to create milestones for the next release. Let me know if you want me to do the same for Mylyn Builds, Mylyn Docs, Mylyn Reviews, Mylyn Versions (I can only grant permissions to committers).</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, please create milestones for those projects. But, I can&apos;t seem to create milestones for any - I don&apos;t have the Administration link at the top.

I was actually wondering if it makes sense to create milestones for the current and the next release after 3.12? Currently we have no good way of planning beyond the current release, so we either have to schedule for the current release bugs we know will not get resolved in that time frame or use some ad hoc means of remembering them, like raising priority.

I think it would be simplest for you to push all the tags since you can just follow the steps at https://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Release_Howto#Tag_Sources. It&apos;s more complicated if we each push only half the tags.

I will look at updating the versions, etc. as soon as I can.</thetext>

We haven&apos;t done that in the past since we never knew the +2 release version :). We have used the &quot;plan&quot; keyword to mark things that we considered part of the backlog and I have seen other projects use a generic &quot;next&quot; milestone for planning purposes. I&apos;m not entirely sure what the criteria would be used to put stuff on the +2 / next milestone? 

I wonder if we should go through the backlog and close all the (non defects) that we don&apos;t consider relevant to make the backlog more manageable.

    <thetext>Thanks. I was thinking a &quot;next&quot; milestone could make sense. I don&apos;t think we would put a large number of things on it, but it would be useful, especially towards the end of the release cycle.

&gt; ? How would you determine which are relevant out of so many?

Good question :). We could merge similar requests more aggressively and close things that don&apos;t match the project scope but it could as well be that we never arrive at a manageable number that way. At least in the past success has been somewhat very limited. I think I managed to reduce the number of open bugs by 300 at some point by filtering duplicates but we still had ~1000 open bugs overall. Having a way to tag tasks to be part of the backlog (e.g. using the next milestone) is probably more efficient even if we end up creating duplicates for stuff that we plan to work on.</thetext>

&gt; Steffen, can you comment on why you removed the API Baselines section of the
&gt; archive page in da5e6b20d6a44f9729b759bfebb6c97c71e9d0d3?

The API baselines were not complete (i.e. not resolvable) since dependencies were missing. It&apos;s easier to provision a baseline by installing (all) Mylyn features into an Eclipse SDK.

&gt; It&apos;s not clear what needs to be done to &quot;update Babel.&quot; Looking at previous
&gt; versions, there are Plugin Exclude Patterns but no Project Source Locations
&gt; defined, so I&apos;m not sure what the point is?

I haven&apos;t looked at Babel in a while. We used to update it for Release train releases but I don&apos;t know what the current state is.</thetext>

    <thetext>Why is it necessary to install into an Eclipse SDK at all? In the past, simply extracting the baseline zip to an empty directory and pointing at that has worked for me.</thetext>

&gt; worked for me.

Interesting. That didn&apos;t work reliably for me the last time I tried that with Eclipse 4.x. The API tooling always complained that it couldn&apos;t resolve bundles in the baseline and I believe therefore didn&apos;t fully verify API changes.</thetext>

    <thetext>I just got Leo to try using 4.3 and extracting the baseline zip to an empty directory and pointing at that. He didn&apos;t have any problems, and the baseline seemed to work correctly. Is there any reason to include anything besides Mylyn in the baseline?</thetext>

My assumption was that the baseline has to be fully resolvable for API tooling to work correctly. If that&apos;s not the case I don&apos;t see any reason to not use the &quot;Mylyn-only&quot; baseline.</thetext>

    <thetext>Sam, did you post an announcement to https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/mylyn-announce/ ? We usually also post something to the news group / web forum and update the News section on the web site: http://eclipse.org/mylyn/ . Looks like the snapshot sections needs updating as well: http://eclipse.org/mylyn/downloads/ .</thetext>

&gt; (In reply to comment #52)
&gt; &gt; I agree. Should we create &quot;next&quot; milestones and see if it turns out to be
&gt; &gt; useful?
&gt; 
&gt; I have added one for the Mylyn project with 10000 as a sort key.

Steffen, I could swear that you added &quot;next&quot; milestones for all the Mylyn projects but it seems only the top level project has one. Did they get removed? If not, could you please add them for Reviews, Docs, Builds, and Versions?</thetext>
