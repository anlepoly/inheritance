    <thetext>The breakpoint support is not coupled to Java and should be moved to a separate bundle. This bundle would also contribute core and ui support for managing breakpoints as part of the context.</thetext>

    <thetext>Sebastian, is the assumption in the description correct? Do you think we&apos;ll need specific support from the language bridges to manage breakpoints?

I would propose to call the bundles:

org.eclipse.mylyn.debug.core
org.eclipse.mylyn.debug.tests
org.eclipse.mylyn.debug.ui

Shawn, what are your thoughts on that?</thetext>

    <thetext>FocusBreakpointsViewAction and FocusDebugViewAction would likely be moved to the new component. This would also ease reuse for other languages, e.g. C++.</thetext>

    <thetext>I *hope* that breakpoint support is language independent as I&apos;m using the IBreakpoint interface from o.e.core.model.IBreakpoint. Anyway, it might be that we need additional label provider for different (e.g. c++) breakpoints. I&apos;ll test that.

The naming sound good. I already added FocusBreakpointsViewAction and the corresponding InterestFilter to the new plugin as suggested (https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/6338/).</thetext>

    <thetext>Ok, thanks. I might just go ahead and create these plug-ins since the contribution gets very big otherwise and there isn&apos;t really anything relevant other than bundle boilerplate.</thetext>

    <thetext>THis sounds like a great plan to me.  Would these be then included as a part of the IDE feature or each of the CDT and Java features?  Seems that there should be a feature that java and cdt can depend on to get this support.</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #6)
&gt; THis sounds like a great plan to me.  Would these be then included as a part of
&gt; the IDE feature or each of the CDT and Java features?  Seems that there should
&gt; be a feature that java and cdt can depend on to get this support.

I was wondering about that, too. The IDE feature could make sense or we may end up creating another debug feature. I might put it into the Java package initially since I don&apos;t want to pull in more dependencies in the IDE feature but I haven&apos;t looked at that in detail.</thetext>

    <thetext>Pushed review here: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/6607/. Turns out that we may not need a core bundle. Sebastian, does that look right to you?</thetext>

    <thetext>I merged the change. I added the o.e.m.debug.ui bundle to the Java bridge feature for now but we can move that based on how dependencies of the bundle evolve.</thetext>
