    <thetext>the following are some errors found during the UI review that need to be investigated:

Properties:
	- Review Level - Tab &quot;All&quot; - the list of properties is not complete
	- The path string is not shown, check it for file contexts and files
	- Formal Review: The class field was not editable
	
Dialogs:
	- The OK button seems enabled even if there is no valid input 

Design Rules:
    - The properties shall match the ones for the group, however one refers to the folder the other one to the file</thetext>

&gt; the following are some errors found during the UI review that need to be
&gt; investigated:
&gt; 
&gt; Properties:
&gt; - Review Level - Tab &quot;All&quot; - the list of properties is not complete
&gt; - The path string is not shown, check it for file contexts and files
&gt; - Formal Review: The class field was not editable

These are fixed

&gt; 
&gt; Design Rules:
&gt; - The properties shall match the ones for the group, however one refers to
&gt; the folder the other one to the file

To be consistent, the group should display the group file, not the folder</thetext>

    <thetext>New additions after discusssing UI review internally among the team.  These are high-priority issues to be resolved before next release is out

- Change R4E Properties view to have only 2 tabs:  List (old All) tab and Edit tab
- Use expandable composites in Edit tab to reduce footprint in view
- Remember folders when triggering ad folder dialogs
- New anomaly dialog:  Deisng rules should be shown in searchable table like in legacy R4E
- Add support to add reply to a Comment

- Disable mouse button scroll in all combo boxes
- Include icon legen in help
- When right-clicking in empty area of the review navigator, show default context-menu (not based on selected tree element)
- New review dialog: Do not put any default review type in combo box
-  All New xxx dialogs: do not enable OK button until minimal information is entered
- Always focus on newly created element in Review navigator tree

    <thetext>Here&apos;s the current status on this item.

- All New xxx dialogs: do not enable OK button until minimal information is entered


OUTSTANDING for July release:

- Change R4E Properties view to have only 2 tabs: List (old All) tab and Edit tab
- Use expandable composites in Edit tab to reduce footprint in view
- Include icon legen in help


OUTSTANDING as future improvements:

- Remember folders when triggering ad folder dialogs
- New anomaly dialog: Deisng rules should be shown in searchable table like in legacy R4E
- Add support to add reply to a Comment
- Always display all options in send notification type dialog
- Fix scrollbars in R4E Properties view that are broken when resizing the view

Will not be implemented
- When right-clicking in empty area of the review navigator, show default context-menu (not based on selected tree element).  
   --&gt; This should not be implemented.  We now behave like any other navigator and changing the code will break that.</thetext>
