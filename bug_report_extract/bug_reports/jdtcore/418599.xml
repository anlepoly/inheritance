    <thetext>All but the one reported on AptConfigurationBlock are related to the fact that org.eclipse.jdt.core bundle stil is not generified as it&apos;s still at 1.4 level. So, either we have to live with this or find a way to exempt these projects from these warnings.</thetext>

Did you really look at the warnings reported by bug 418599? Those are all about unnecessary @SuppressWarnings annotations. The reason for this is that the build does not report unavoidable generic type problems (the thing you just asked for ;-). So, you also need to set the same option on your projects and remove the unnecessary @SuppressWarnings annotations.</thetext>

Matter of fact, I did. But I failed to see the relevance the &apos;Ignore unavoidable ...&apos; option had on this. I was confused that I couldn&apos;t replicate the unused warnings on my local workspace just with the &apos;Suppress ... &quot; options.</thetext>

&gt; Looks like there are still some left.

No, looks like a bug with the JDT compiler used by the build. The warnings appear on my local workspace when I use build I20130918-2000. But not with 4.3.1. I will raise a bug for this after a bit more experiment.</thetext>

The build correctly reports the warnings and in fact you say yourself that you see them with I20130918-2000. So, you just have to fix them. 4.3.1 has absolutely nothing to do with this bug (the code is from &apos;master&apos; and the official build uses the 4.4 M2 compiler).</thetext>

What I meant by I20130918-2000 and M2 is the eclipse SDK version I used to load the JDT/Core source. If the unavoidableGenericTypeProblems is disabled, why should I still get warnings?</thetext>

Because those are not falling under that umbrella.</thetext>

You are right, but apparently not before bug 338350 was fixed, and that explains why I didn&apos;t see the warnings with 4.3.1. But looking at the code, one of them is a straight forward fix but other two deal with Collection and not a straight forward fix. So, I think we better &apos;suppress&apos; these and live with the &apos;other&apos; warning.</thetext>

There was no &apos;other&apos; warning involved here. Sorry for the confusion. I have fixed these via:
