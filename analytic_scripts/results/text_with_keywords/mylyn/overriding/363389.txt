BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
A protection has been implemented so if a user file at group level already exists for a new user, 
a new file is created with a consequtive number e.g. "_1" appended after the user id.
  This scenario would happen if e.g. the new user has the same id of an existing one but with a different case combination
  e.g. EEIABCD and eeiABCD
  
  However in order to simplify the internal handling and prevent multiple entries for the same user, 
  the UI has been modified to allow user id entries in lower case only.  see Bug 363838.
