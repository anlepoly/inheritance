BUG TITLE:
[api] settings page constructor should not rely on overridden methods

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Yes, you are right, this isn't a complete fix but it's good enough to address the problem while retaining backwards compatibility. When we break API we should properly fix this (but at that point we would make a lot more changes to the settings page, I'm sure).
