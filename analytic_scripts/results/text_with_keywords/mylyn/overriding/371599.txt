BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I have done 3 things to address this problem:

* Requested a fix in platform to fix the failing workbench startup (bug 371611)
* Set stricter version constraints in the 3.6.5 release to prevent updating of stubs into 3.6.5 (bug 371626)
* Added the implementation back into the stubs but removed all extensions. This will ensure that if stubs are installed with Mylyn [3.6.0,3.6.5) or [3.7.0,3.7.0.I2012) the workbench will still load. In that case there will be a minor loss in functionality (missing New Team Repository Wizard and Team Repositories View) which is easy to recover from by updating to the latest 3.7.0 integration build.

Please reopen if anything was missed.
