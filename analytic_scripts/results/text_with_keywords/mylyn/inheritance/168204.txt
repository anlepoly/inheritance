BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
if usermatchmode is on and you assign the bug to somebody else by putting only part of the username in the assignee field a window pops up asking for a confirmation of the possible found users.
hitting the confirm button will result in a "File Not Found":

"The file /process_bug.cgi cannot be found. Please check the location and try again."

popup after a submit

this screenshot shows the popup once I set a new assignee and submitted the ticket.
In the upper left corner you see already an error message.

I see this every time this kind of window pops up. No matter whether I connect to my out-of-the-box bugzilla or to our company's bugzilla.

the next attachmend will show what happened once I click on "continue"

I assume that you are able to use full email addresses?

For now I added a FAQ entry: http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylar_FAQ#Bugzilla_Connector_troubleshooting
Rob,

I found this bug and want to know if we should resolve this. For me it looks like this can somehow related to bug 152415.

The actual problem is that we get  an html page with the possible users as theresult of the post method.
But the actual code only handle errors.

If we fix this we should first come up with the correct workflow.
Maybe we do this after bug 202879 and bring up a special version of a Content Assist. But keep in mind that we can have more then one attribute to process (Assigned to, QA Contact, add CC).

regards

Frank

In the case of usermatch enabled and the user enters partial names for more than one field, the followup dialog could present all fields with suggestions returned by bugzilla, then either resubmit with the values selected or if possible complete the original submission correctly. Marking bug#202879 as a subtask of this.

Frank, can you please use convention "bug NNNN" when referring to other issues, so the hyperlink detector would be able to match on a standard pattern. Thanks.
Frank, I hope to put some time into reviewing patches this week. Sorry for the delay.

Patch

This patch is include a patch for  bug#210283 and the previous  path.
This was done because I think the are related.

Patch for bug#202879 is also included to demonstrate how all fit together. 

All this must wait until bug#179254 is resolved.

If you work on this I can separate this one patch to the corresponding  bugs for a better review.

Need to defer: http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylyn/3.0_Plan#Deferred_Items
Due to the 3.0 editor refactoring  this patch is now stale. Before diving back in here Frank we'll need to discuss how this is going work with the new editor.

Rob, we should also consider a user cache similar to the one implemented for JIRA. This would also make it easier to implement content assist that would match full names.

Frank,  I agree in principle with the Bugzilla side of the plumbing to make this work.  Since it doesn't apply I didn't do a thorough UI review (i.e. how errors and suggestions manifest themselves in the editor).  You may want to hold off on going to deep on UI until bug 236504 is worked out.

The general idea of this patch looks good to me. I think we need some more discussion about the UI presentation of the errors. We might want to use ControlDecorations to highlight fields with errors. 

Rob, maybe it would make sense to apply the core part of the patch and leave the ui bits for the next milestone?

patch with ControlDecoration

now we use ControlDecorations to highlight fields with errors but after the first keystroke in that field we remove the decoration. 

Is this OK?

Cool stuff Frank.  Patch is a little stale but I'm not worried about merging since little else will be changing in the client for 3.2 so if you and Steffen are agreed, I'd like to apply this in is entirety immediately after 3.2 (once we've reviewed the UI).

Yes this is OK for me, should I create an updated patch after 3.2?
That would be great!

Should we change the Target Milestone to 3.2.1?
My sense is that this should go into 3.3. since this it is a new feature.
Is this going to make 3.3?
Unfortunately we'll have to move this to a future release since it will require extensions in the task editor.

Can include this in 3.4?
Yes, we can make API enhancements now and take that on for 3.4.

The UI  supports decoration for the error. Content assist is not used, only  a tooltip show the leagal values.

Will do.
