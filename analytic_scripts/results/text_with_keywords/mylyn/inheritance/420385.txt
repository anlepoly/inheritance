BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Thanks for the really quick responses on this, guys - it's really heartening. I suspected EMF/Ecore generation was doing the automatic extension creation - it's a bit sneaky like that, I know from my own experience.

I've been able to verify using the 3.10 snapshot from yesterday, and can verify that the files created by RTC are being correctly saved and read.

I've also performed a sanity check by using the host OSGi console to call "pt -v org.eclipse.emf.ecore.extension_parser". No results from Mylyn - thank you!
