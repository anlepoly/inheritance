"Creole is a common wiki markup language to be used across different wikis. It's not replacing existing markup but instead enabling wiki users to transfer content seamlessly across wikis, and for novice users to contribute more easily." - http://www.wikicreole.org/

This project is fairly successful, therefore it would be useful if Mylyn WikiText supported it out-of-the-box.

There are various parser libraries available at http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Engines including T4 WikiParser (T4-WP), a Java-based parser http://web-tec.info/WikiParser/

WikiCreole supports extensions. There should be an option to either a) hide all extension text or b) display all extension text in fixed-width text.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Mylyn WikiText
2. There is no Creole :)
Thanks for the feature request. 

As you may already know Mylyn WikiText is extensible and can support new wiki syntaxes quite easily.  That said, it's not the intention of the Mylyn WikiText project to directly implement every wiki syntax.  It's expected that third parties will use Mylyn WikiText as a framework and add on extensions to support wiki syntaxes.  Currently Mylyn WikiText supports syntaxes for which there is a corresponding Mylyn connector, and MediaWiki which is the backbone of EclipsePedia.

If you're interested in contributing Creole wiki syntax then please get involved.  You may want to participate in one of our "weekly conference calls":http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Meetings  Feel free to add an agenda item and phone in.
