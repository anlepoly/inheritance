BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I don't see any straight forward way to enable the actions just for the context editor when no context is active. It looks like the existing contributions would need to be converted into commands which have a richer context but it's not worth doing at this point.

The review at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#change,7274 was merged into master.  Thanks for your contribution!
