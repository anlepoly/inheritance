BUG TITLE:
[api] provide extension point for task activation listeners

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Thanks a lot for the updated patch! 

I have applied it with a few minor modifications: 
* I renamed the schema attribute from "listenerClass" to "class"
* I guarded the creation of extensions with a catch Throwable. Not pretty but some extensions have the bad habit of throwing LinkageErrors which would propagate otherwise.
* Moved the constant to TaskActivityManager
* The test stub is now an inner class and test cases are separate
