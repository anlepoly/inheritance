BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Thanks for pointing that out. I pushed f434554eaaa7098132b06e7178af63e4d15ecca1 to fix this. o.e.m.context.ui is now explicitly activated. Arguably this should be triggered by o.e.m.context.core but I didn't want introduce another extension point at this point.

I have triggered a new weekly build. Please reopen in case you are still experiencing problems after updating to the latest.
