Dear David,

thank you for the hint with FOUR backslashes ...
Confluence documentations says:
If you need to separate the text within lists using line breaks, make sure you do so using a double slash (//). Empty lines may disrupt the list.

I checked my test environment. The source values, which contain Confluence wiki markup, come from an Excel file. The strange thing is, that the example text in the Excel file does not contain four backslashes: \\server\drive\folder\file but at the time when I parse this text with your MarkupParser it contains four backslashes where was two and two where was one: \\\\server\\drive\\folder\\file

Perhaps Apache POI added the backslashes ... I have to check.
