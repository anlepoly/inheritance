BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Currently, __defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__ are working but the lookup-related methods are not implemented.  This prevents various functional programming techniques, like "decorating" an existing method with a join point (like in aspect-oriented programming, for example).
I'm investigating this.  Started to code a fix.
Ran this against test suites with no new failures and fixed one test case (js1_5/GetSet/getset-006.js)
Fixed:

Checking in NativeObject.java;
/cvsroot/mozilla/js/rhino/src/org/mozilla/javascript/NativeObject.java,v  <--  NativeObject.java
new revision: 1.44; previous revision: 1.43
done
Checking in ScriptableObject.java;
/cvsroot/mozilla/js/rhino/src/org/mozilla/javascript/ScriptableObject.java,v  <--  ScriptableObject.java
new revision: 1.118; previous revision: 1.117
done

BTW, the test for this is js1_5/extensions/getset-006.js. 
Adding target milestone of 1.6R6 based on the date this bug was resolved FIXED.
