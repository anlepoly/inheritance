BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
It would be nice if Rhino would support at least some parts of SpiderMonkey
getter/setter functionality.
The patch changes the current glue code to pass the name of the called
interface method as the last parameter to JS function.

This is useful for debugging, for example, even without extending the
conversion to interfaces with multiple methods with the same signature.
Attachment for the wrong bug...
This patch implements __defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__ functions in the
Object prototype. Implementation in ScriptableObject is analogous to Java
getter/setter methods, but with a ScriptedGetterSlot class that uses
o.m.j.Function as getter/setter instead of o.m.j.MemberBox.

Defining getters/setters in object initializers isn't implemented by this patch
as I'm a bit scared of messing with the Rhino parsing code.
Thanks for the patch, it is quite resonable besides few hotspots and the need
to replace Function by Callable. In Rhino 1.6R2 object can be called if it
implements just Callable, not Function inter
