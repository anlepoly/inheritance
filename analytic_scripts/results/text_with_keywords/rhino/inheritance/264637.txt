Build Identifier: 

The boolean flag "evalScriptFlag" in the class InterpretedFunction could be 
moved to InterpretedData. This would make InterpretedFunction (of which one 
instance is created per declared function per script execution) lighter, on 
expense of InterpretedData (of which one instance is created per declared 
function per script parsing).

With support for continuations in 1.6, it is also important to be able to stub 
out as much of the objects representing an interpreted function as possible when 
serializing interim state, and reconnect to the already present shared instances 
upon deserialization. It is therefore important to push as much of the immutable 
state as possible to InterpreterData class - I will likely follow up with 
proposals for further reductions in InterpretedFunction's base class, 
NativeFunction. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

I committed the patch: it is sufficiently simple not to cause any problems.
