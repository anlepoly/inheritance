BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
ECMA extension to support function expression statements in Rhino behaves
differently from SM and MSIE as it produces value which affects eval results.
For example, given the following, 

var x = eval('0; if (true) function f() {}')
print(x)

Rhino assigns to x the function f and prints 

function f() {
}

while SM assigns to x 0 and prints 0. With the standard function statements
Rhino behaves correctly and print(eval('0; function f() {}')) gives correct 0.
Testcase added to JS testsuite:

      mozilla/js/tests/ecma_3/Statements/regress-194364.js

Currently passing in SpiderMonkey, and failing in Rhino as 
Igor reported above -

I commited the fix
Verified FIXED - the testcase in Comment #1 now passes in Rhino.
I tested this with optimization levels -1, 0, 1, 9.
Targeting as resolved against 1.5R5
