BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
It would be nice to have a strict mode in Rhino that would at least throw an
exception for missing var declarations.

The patch adds Context.FEATURE_STRICT_MODE feature and -strict flag to Rhino
shell that would report a runtime error for assignments to undeclared variables
and calling eval with anything but string. 
With the patch I have in Rhino shell:

~/rhino/tip> java -jar build/rhino1_6R1/js.jar -strict
Rhino 1.6 release 1_pre_RC2 2004 09 23
js> x = 1
js: "<stdin>", line 1: Attempt to assign non-existing name "x" in the strict
mode. It could indicate a missing variable statement.
js> eval(0)
js: "<stdin>", line 2: Calling eval() with anything other than a primitive
string value is not allowed in the strict mode.
js> 



The patch splits Context.FEATURE_STRICT_MODE into Context.FEATURE_STRICT_VARS
and Context.FEATURE_STRICT_EVAL

In this way the Rhino embeddings will be immune from extending strict mode
notion to other areas like disabling automatic semicolon insertion. But the
patch keeps -strict flag i
