BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Currently any usage of IdFunction requires to implement at least 2 methods in
IdFunctionMaster, execMethod and methodArity in addition to code to create
IdFunction instances. If methodArity is replaced by passing the arity value
directly to IdFunction constructor, the usage would be simpler.
The patch did not touch IdScriptable ands its subclasses besides changing
methodArity in IdScriptable from public to protected since IdScriptable needs
to get an arity value form its subclasses which brings patrch minuses:

1. Additional method invocation per each IdFunction instance initialization in
IdScriptable subclasses.

2. Additional field in IdScriptable.

Perhaps for code that wants to add a function or two without using reflection
it would be better to define something like JavaFunction or SimpleFunction that
should be extended to override the call method?
I renamed title since it seems a separated class to provide IdFunction
functionality without a requirement to implement an additional interface would
be a goo
