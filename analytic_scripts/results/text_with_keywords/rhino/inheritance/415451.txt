Bob, can you review the proposed regression test when you have a chance?
r+ but put it in js1_5/extensions since Array.prototype.indexOf is not required by the standard.

Could you flip the in-litmus flag to - and the in-testsuite flag to + when you check in please?
Actually, js1_6/Array is the better place for this.
Checking in
