BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Currently in Rhino importPackage and importCass are available when
ImporterTopLevel is a scope object. I suggest to add JavaImporter constructor to
Rhino that would construct explicit ImporterTopLevel objects. The constructor
should be initialized during Context.initStandardObjects call to allow in all
scripts a usage like:

var Swing = new JavaImporter();
Swing.importPackage(Packages.java.awt.event);
Swing.importPackage(Packages.javax.swing);
Swing.importClass(Packages.java.awt.EventQueue);

and later:

var btn = new Swing.JButton()
etc.

In this way it would be possible to create ready-to-use aliases to package
groups in application without danger of namespace pollution.

The constructor should also allow to pass a list of packages/classes to import
to simplify usage:

var Swing = new JavaImporter(Packages.java.awt.event,
                             Packages.javax.swing,
			     Packages.java.awt.EventQueue);

The extension should be orthogonal to the current usage of ImporterTopLevel as
top scope object.
