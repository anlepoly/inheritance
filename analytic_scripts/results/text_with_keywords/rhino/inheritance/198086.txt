BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Currently Rhino optimizer generates one Java class per JavaScript function which
may lead to significant runtime overhead. I think it would be worth to try to
replace that by a single class with a switch dispatch to select code for a
particular function. I open this report to record work on it.
This is a small step to address the issue, but it makes sense on its own since
currently script containing

function f() { return 1; }
function g() { return 1; }

print(f()+g()+Math.sqrt(1));

would create 3 classes each contain a code to generate a wrapper Number object
to represent 1 and with the patch the single constant from the class for the
main script will be used.
This is an extension of the previous patch to place code implementing functions
bodies in single class. 

With the new patch classes implementing functions contain only constructor and
a call method that calls a static method 

c<function-index>(<FunctionClass> function, Context cx. Scriptable scope,
Scriptable thisObj, <possible-direct-call-params>,
