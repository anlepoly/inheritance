BUG TITLE:
JavaScriptException to extend RuntimeException and common exception base

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Currently Rhino runtime can throw 3 different types of exceptions:

1. JavaScriptException that is thrown by JavaScript throw statement.
2. EcmaError that represents JavaScript runtime exception as specified by ECMA
standard.
3. EvaluatorException that is thrown on compilation errors and as a wrapper for
exceptions in Java functions.

Since JavaScriptException extends Exception, it has to be always declared in the
method signature. In principle this useful to provide a hint that a particular
API can execute some JavaScript code. But in practice it does not work this way
since virtually any Rhino API method can cause indirect execution of JavaScript
code and in most such cases the API does not have "throws JavaScriptException"
declaration.

For example, Context.toString(Object) executes toString function if it is
defined for the object and it can be defined with JavaScript. In addition any
native method including getters and setters can trigger JS execution and "throws
JavaScriptException" is not included in S
