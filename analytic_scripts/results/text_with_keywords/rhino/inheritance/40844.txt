BUG TITLE:
Incorrect static method called for inherited class

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
From Rhino Newsgroup (netscape.public.mozilla.jseng):

I have potentially discovered a problem with Javascript.  Here is my java code:
 
public abstract class ParentClass {
 
    public static void printSomething() {
        System.out.println("ParentClass.printSomething()");
    }
}
 
 
public class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
 
    public static void printSomething() {
        System.out.println("ChildClass.printSomething()");
    }
}
 
java org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main
 
js> importClass(Packages.ChildClass);
js>
js> ChildClass.printSomething();
ParentClass.printSomething();
js> quit();
 
Now, I could be wrong, but the way I understand things, it seems like the Child 
Class method should be invoked here.  Is this something similar to the bug 
report I found in:  37381?
 
Thanks,
