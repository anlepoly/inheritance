BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Currently Rhino does not support long string literals with more then 64K of
characters, which can be a problem to run it against automatically generated
scripts.
Test that the interpreter can handle string literals exceeding 64K limit. For
that the script passes to eval "str ='LONG_STRING_LITERAL';" where
LONG_STRING_LITERAL is a string with 200K chars.
The current 64K limit comes from omj/Parser.java where it constructs the
internal script presentation for future decompilation. The patch extends this
form to allow string sequences with more then 64K characters and modifes
decompilation code in omj/NativeFunction.java accordingly.
Note that the above patch does not extend support for extremely long strings to
the compiler mode due to 64K limit on string in Java classfile format, but at
least with interpreter mode a Java-based browser can support a generate HTML
containing

<script>
...
document.write('HTML CODE WITH MORE THEN 64K CHARACTERS');
...
</script>
