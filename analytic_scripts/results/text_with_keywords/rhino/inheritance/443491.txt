BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I'm trying to figure out if this failing piece of code fails due to a
bug in Rhino. The short of it is that we have a global object (in this
case an instance of TestBean) that has a read-only property named
"blah"; we execute some JS code which attempts to define a function
named "blah" (and does so successfully, I think), but when the code
attempts to call this new function, Rhino picks up the read-only
"blah" property on the global object (rather than the function) --
throwing a TypeError.

The real-world application of this is in HtmlUnit: the global object
in an HTML document is the window, which has (for example) a read-only
"navigator" property. However, you are allowed to define a function
named "navigator" and call it (hiding the real "navigator" property).

Have a look at the code below and let me know what you think... Should
this work in Rhino? Is it a bug? Is it misconfiguration?

Take care,

Daniel

public class TestBean extends ScriptableObject {
    private Object blah = "a";
    public Object
