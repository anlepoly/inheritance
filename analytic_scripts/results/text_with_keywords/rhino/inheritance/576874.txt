BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
See: http://github.com/ringo/ringojs/issues#issue/73

If reflection on a Java class fails because of a java.lang.SecurityException, the result isn't cached in JavaMembers.lookupClass() and the lookup is repeated for each new java object wrapper, resulting in repeated warning messages like:

js: warning: "ringo/encoding.js", line 19: Could not discover accessible methods of class sun.nio.cs.HistoricallyNamedCharset due to lack of privileges, attemping superclasses/interfaces.


Committed patch.
