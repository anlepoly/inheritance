BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Turned out, we can easily avoid the NPE by pre-populating all type variable's superclass with java.lang.Object (that's what we do later anyway).

This leaves you with a bunch of compile errors but no NPE. Test and fix released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=1394edf1116ec1563c76f21ce03154bae6bb9472
