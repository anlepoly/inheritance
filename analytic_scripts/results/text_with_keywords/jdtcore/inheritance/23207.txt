BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
tried with 20020903-I on w2k and linux-gtk:

It seems that the deprecated flag isn't set for IMethod.

---8<--- A.java ---
public class A {
	/**
	 * @deprecated
	 */
    public void foo(int value) {}
}
---8<--- B.java ---
public class B extends A {
	
    /**
     * @see A#foo(int)
     * @depreacated        <--- this line is missing
     */
	public void foo(int value) {}
}
---8<---

The javadoc for B.foo() was created with "Source :: Add JavaDoc Comment".
It should notice the deprecated flag in A.foo() and add the @deprecated tag
to the JavaDoc comment (See use in AddJavaDocStubOperation:86).
This belongs to the javadoc generator.
Philippe,

I'm using the same code for generating javadocs using auto-indentation and I 
don't see an obvious error in using the flags of IMethod. I just added the 
example to show you where the problem surfaces. Is there a misunderstanding in 
how to use these flags?
Oh, I see. We will investigate.

Jerome - are we flushing the deprecated flag when applying the bitmask ?
Yes, we we
