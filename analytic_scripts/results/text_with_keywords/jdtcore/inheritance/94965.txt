Code Assist suggest all member types when completion token is a single name.

Y<complete here> // p.q.X.Y is proposed.

As all member types are proposed, code assist does not propose types of the
wrong kind.
Only classes are proposed inside an extends clause, only interfaces inside an
implements clause and only annotations in annotation reference (It was necessary
before to be able to propose a top level type which contains these types).
excellent! ;-)
Verified on build I20050526-2000-win32.
