BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I20070525-1350

The following test case raises two errors with JDT, no errors with javac 1.5.0_12 or 6_02:

public class X<T> {
    public void bar(K<T, Object> p) {
	   new Y(p); // err1
	   new Y((J<T, Object>) p); // err2
       new Y((I<T, Object>) p);
    }
}
class Y<T, U> {
  Y(I<? extends T, ? extends U> p) {
  }
  Y(J<T, ? extends U> p) {
  }
}
interface I<T, U> {  
}
interface J<T, U> extends I<T, U> {
}
interface K<T, U> extends I<T, U>, J<T, U> {
}

Build I20070523-0010 (aka a bit later than RC1, with was 20070517-1700) shows no error, but three warnings only (as javac does when using -Xlint:unchecked).

Note that if J does not extend I, both JDT and javac complain on line err1.
Reverting the change of bug 18761 fixes the problem.
Released inactive test cases AmbiguousMethodTest#60 and 61 in HEAD.

This is not the right bug number. Did you mean bug 188960 ?

No. Bug 188741 (one digit wrong, apologies).
