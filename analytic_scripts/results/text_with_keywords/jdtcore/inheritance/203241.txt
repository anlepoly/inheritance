BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Build ID: I20070625-1500

Steps To Reproduce:
1. make sure the "Serializable class without serialVersionUID" potential programming problem is set to "warning" or "error" in Eclipse (or project specific) preferences
2. create a new class like this:

import java.io.Serializable;

public abstract class A implements Serializable
{

}

EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:
Eclipse should show a warning/error because A is serializable and does not define a serialVersionUID

OBSERVED BEHAVIOUR:
Eclipse does not show any warning/error.

More information:
The absence of any error/warning might lead to a programming problem as soon as you are defining a hierarchy of serializable classes (where any of the ancestor is abstract) and you want to make any of the leaf classes safe (with respect to serialization) in the long-term.
I don't think it makes sense to add a serial version UID to a abstract class.
It can't be instantiated and therefore also not serializable. The concrete
subclasses however should have a serial version UID.
