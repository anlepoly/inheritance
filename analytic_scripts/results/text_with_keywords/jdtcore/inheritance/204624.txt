Test case

Build ID: I20070621-1340

Steps To Reproduce:
Try the code in the attachment. It compiles with no errors in Eclipse, although there are two warnings. But the Sun Java 1.5.0_12 command-line compiler fails on the same code with this error.

org\eclipse\bugs\AbstractTest.java:9: org.eclipse.bugs.TestImpl is not abstract and does not override abstract method <T>go(java.util.List<T>) in org.eclipse.bugs.AbstractTest
class TestImpl extends AbstractTest {
^

The Eclipse compiler should be consistent with the Sun compiler.

There are several other bugs which I think may be related: Bug 159851, Bug 166355, Bug 203905.
