BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Enhancement request for 3.1 stream. 

Files with non *.java extension, but with normal Java contents should also be 
treated as normal Java code, when associated with Java type editor. All core 
functionality (like code outline, automated builds, code completion, etc.) 
should also be available, not only source syntax highlight.

I'm trying to make Eclipse based project with Apache Beehive. All JPF, JCS, 
JCX, etc. files are normal Java files with JSR 175 annotations. I would like to 
preserve the compatability with Beehive defined extensions for the future, 
while working normally on Java code.

Thanks,
Alex.

Will conduct preliminary investigations before committing.
I can't wait for this enhancement ... 

I'm trying to reuse org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.CompilationUnitEditor
using editor extension like but to set different file extension:

<extension point="org
