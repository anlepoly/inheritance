BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
1) create the class X.java
import javax.swing.JPanel;
public class X {
  void foo(){
    new JPanel(){
      class InnerPanel extends JPanel {
        public InnerPanel() {
          setLayout(<cursor>
        }
      }
    };
  }
}
2) do ctrl+space at cursor location.
There is two proposals with the same completion. One of these proposals is the 
method of the anonymous type. This completion should not be proposed.
The symptoms of this bug are the same of the bug 33172, but i don't think that 
is the same problem.
Fix for bug 35232 correct this bug.

Fixed.
Verified with build I200312160010
