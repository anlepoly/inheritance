import java.util.ArrayList;
public class NumberThing<T extends Number> extends ArrayList<T> {
        void test() {
                NumberThing<?> questionmarkThing = new NumberThing<Double>();
                questionmarkThing.get(0);
        }
}

Look at the resolved type binding of the method invocation 'questionmarkThing.get(0)'. This is a capture binding with type bounds {java.lang.Number} (the 'Number' comes from the declaration of type variable T).

ITypeBinding#isCapture() says that these bounds should be available from getTypeBounds(), but that method's Javadoc contradicts this by talking about the 'declared' or 'explicit' bounds.

The current implementation of getTypeBounds() does not return the first bound, but it does return additional bounds (e.g. with <T extends Number & Runnable & Cloneable>).

I don't think it makes sense to keep up the current implementation of getTypeBounds() for capture types, since capture types are always generated and never have 'explicit' type bounds. Cl
