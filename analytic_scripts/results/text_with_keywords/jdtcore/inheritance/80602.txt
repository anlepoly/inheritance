BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I20041208-1200

Javadocs of ASTNode#getStartPosition() and #getLength() contain dangling
references to ASTParser:
	 * See {@link ASTParser} for details
	 * on precisely where source ranges begin and end.

I could not find any information in ASTParser that would describe the source
range more precisely. As I understand the API, the source range always stretches
over the whole range delineated by the grammar section in an ASTNode subclass'
javadoc.
Jeem,
Perhaps may you provide help on this?
Thanks
Thanks for catching this. I've changed the specs to {@link ASTParser#setKind
(int)}, which is where the source range is explained. Yes, the source range 
always stretches over the whole range delineated by the grammar section in an 
ASTNode subclass' javadoc. Leading and training whitespace and comments are 
not included (but BodyDeclarations have optional Javadoc child node and do 
include preceding doc comment).

Updated build notes. Closing.
