BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Build id: I20090313-0100 (3.5 M6)

1. Create a java project containing:

package test;
public final class TestClass {}
interface TestInterface {}
class Subclass extends test.Test|{}

2. At the '|' symbol do CTRL+SPACE. You will see
the token Test being completed into test.TestInterface

This proposal is bad and leads to an immediate error
(super class must be a class error)
This is not reproducible in 3.5-M7.

Can you check again ? I could reproduce this with 

Eclipse SDK

Version: 3.5.0
Build id: I20090430-2300

which is M7 as well as with HEAD.




Interesting .... when I have all these in the same compilation unit, I am able to reproduce it. But, if I create a project, add a package test, add TestClass, TestInterface, SubClass one after another (thus there are three compilation units), I am not able to reproduce this. So apparently this has something to do with all the types being in the same compilation unit.
