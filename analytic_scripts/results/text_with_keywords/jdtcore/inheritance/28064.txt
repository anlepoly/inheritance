BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Build I20021210

I cannot reproduce this, but I hit an infinite loop in the ast resolving code. 
I will attach the log file, and the compilation unit that was being edited at
the time.  The CU had definite compilation errors, and it had an anonymous
subclass declaration in a field initializer that probably caused the error.

Likely a duplicate of 27616
Simple test case :
public class X {
  #
  X x = new X(){}
}

Select 'X' in 'new X()' and do F3.
bug 27616 is not a duplicate.
Fixed.
Verified.
