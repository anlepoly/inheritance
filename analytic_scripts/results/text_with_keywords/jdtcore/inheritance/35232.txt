BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
1) create Y.java
public class Y {
  public static void foo(){}
}
2) create X.java
public class X {
  void bar(){
    new Y(){
      class Z extends Y {
        void bar(){
          foo<cursor>
        }
      }
    };
  }
}
3) do ctrl+space at cursor location
One of the completions is "<anonymous subclass of Y>.foo()". This completion is 
not correct.
Will consider later
reopen
Fixed and test added (CompletionTests#testCompletionStaticMethod1)
