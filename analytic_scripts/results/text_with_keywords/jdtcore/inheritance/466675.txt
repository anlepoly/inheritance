comparator errors, after updating to Saturday's build

Even though a "test build", I think the "comparator log" generated will be accurate for what it will be tonight (Sunday, 8 PM) so if anyone wanted to "touch" these two bundles before the build, to "set things right". The two bundles flagged are, I am assuming, simple cases where they were modified while the M7 compiler was being used, hence have to be touched again, to be "reset" to the "normal" behavior of compiler. 

diffing the 'artifactComparison directories' gives the following:
