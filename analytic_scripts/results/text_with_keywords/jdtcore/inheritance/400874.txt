BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
The first phase of implementing type inference according to part G of JSR 335 spec has been completed. I pushed all changes into BETA_JAVA8 via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=6940f5238f5f044dc7dc7f5472f64a2c5617a365

Follow-up work incl various levels of reviewing will be organized via bug 424053 into which I will soon extract all those questions from this bug that are still relevant.

This terminates the development in branch sherrmann/NewTypeInference, which is, however, left on the server to preserve the (fine grained) history.
