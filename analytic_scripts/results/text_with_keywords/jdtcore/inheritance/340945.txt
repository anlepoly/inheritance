Oops. I just now saw this comment. Terribly sorry for the delay. Can you file a bug for this against JDT/UI, and check why an extended context is not requested by the collector in that case? The behaviour wrt JDT/Core will not depend on the primary or secondary lists, but the way the completion APIs are called changes from JDT/UI. I don't have much knowledge about how that second list uses JDT/Core. Thanks!
