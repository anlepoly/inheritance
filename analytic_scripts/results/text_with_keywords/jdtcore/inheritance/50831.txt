It would be helpful to have the default, well known Javadoc tag names available
as constants.
TagElement would be a good place to have them.

E.g. 
public static final String PARAM= "@param";
public static final String RETURN= "@return";
...
Here are proposed constants which would be added to 
org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.TagElement:

	/**
	 * Constants for well know javadoc tag names.
	 */
	public static final String TAG_DEPRECATED = "@deprecated"; //$NON-NLS-1$
	public static final String TAG_PARAM = "@param"; //$NON-NLS-1$
	public static final String TAG_RETURN = "@return"; //$NON-NLS-1$
	public static final String TAG_THROWS = "@throws"; //$NON-NLS-1$
	public static final String TAG_EXCEPTION = "@exception"; //$NON-NLS-1$
	public static final String TAG_SEE = "@see"; //$NON-NLS-1$
	public static final String TAG_LINK = "@link"; //$NON-NLS-1$
	public static final String TAG_LINKPLAIN = "@linkplain"; //$NON-NLS-1$
	public static final String TAG_INHERITDOC = "@inheritDoc"; //$NON-NLS-1$
