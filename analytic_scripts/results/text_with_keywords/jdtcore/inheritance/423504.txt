BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I updated the implementation of PTB.getSingleAbstractMethod from the new version of 9.8.

Some cleanup of the impl. of 18.5.3.

Included the correction that "inferenceFinished" shouldn't say true too early.

Pushed everything as http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=799bcf90c7e5ed6ce45339b7f5c6f4ecccd1d29c

I will proceed testing this via other bugs (next in line: bug 420525).
