In some cases I get a problem reported for unnecessary declaration of checked warning even though it is documented in Javadoc.

It normally works but not all the time.

Test Case:
1. checkout org.eclipse.ui.tests and org.eclipse.ui.tests.harness
2. open org.eclipse.ui.tests.ide.api.FileEditorInputTest
   ==> correct warning on FileEditorInputTest.OtherFileEditorInput.getStorage()
3. use quick fix to document it
4. save
   ==> warning still there
>unnecessary declaration of checked warning
Should read: unnecessary declaration of thrown checked exception
Reproduced. The key to get the erroneous behavior seems to be the use of the 'Check overriding and implementing methods' flag. If it's off, the warning disappears (as long as we set the 'Ignore exceptions documented with...' flag). Also noticed that the class was not extended in my workspace, but this may be irrelevant to the case. Will check the expected meaning of the options as documented and comment again here.
While the doc is not 100% clea
