BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Code assist works fine in this example having been fixed by other recent
resolved bugzilla(s). However I noticed that this test case triggers an
NPE if the semicolon in the return statement is removed. 

Fix and tests for that problem released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=31f5d8c3352dfd40743cbafcdc19d9f5e7640d54
