BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Fix and tests released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=e282ddab29d814ffa1b5ad524aead5edb8a36955

When https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=418981 is fixed,
ParameterizedTypeBinding's can also have AnnotatedVariants, so the
Bit24 cannot be overloaded anymore as there will be a clash - I'll
add a note on that bug.
