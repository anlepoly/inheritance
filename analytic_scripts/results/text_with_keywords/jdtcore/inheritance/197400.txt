BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Build ID: I20070621-1340

Steps To Reproduce:
Using this code
====
public class Test {
	static {
		<>
	}
}
====
Try autocomplete within the <> area. The NPE will be thrown. 

More information:
This was first found in eclipse 3.2 and reproducible in 3.3.
Sorry, I cannot reproduce this using plain Eclipse SDK.
I also tested with this build on another machine
Version: 3.2.2
Build id: M20070212-1330

with a static block

static{<>}

and then try auto-completing, ie ctrl-space within the angle brackets.
