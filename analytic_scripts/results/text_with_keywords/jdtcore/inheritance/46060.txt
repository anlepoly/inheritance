BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
In the class LogicDiagramEditPart, which extends a class which implements a 
method defined on an interface which is implemented in the superclass, I am 
trying to extend that method:

public Object getAdapter(Class adapter) {
	if (adapter == SnapToHelper.class)
		return new SnapToHelper() {
			public Point getSnappedDragDelta(Point raw) {
				return null;
			}
		};
	return super.getA<<CARET>>;
}

When content assist is invoked at the caret, "getAdapter(Class)" should be 
proposed but isn't.
I can not repruduce the problem but i am not sure to have understood your test 
case.

Is it the following test case ?

public class LogicDiagramEditPart extends Y {
  public Object getAdapter(Class adapter){
    if (adapter == SnapToHelper.class)
      return new SnapToHelper() {
        Point getSnappedDragDelta(Point raw) {
          return null;
        }
      };
      return super.getA
  }
}
public class Y implements I {
  public Object getAdapter(Class adapter){return null}
}
public intertace I {
  public Object ge
