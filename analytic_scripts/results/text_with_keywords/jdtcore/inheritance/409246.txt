Thanks, The patch looks good, but I had somewhat similar fix already in place 
that went in via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=e1bb62a6f97249ff77a2f0164d289109644f1d09. 

This commit also significantly refactors/reorganizes the class LocationCollector
in Annotation.getLocations().

I apologize: I didn't mean to step on your toes: This proved to be a special 
case of the more general problem addressed by https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=418347
and that bug was blocking me in other big projects.

I'll assign some more items where we won't have such collisions.
