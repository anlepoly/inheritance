BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Build ID: I20070209-1006

Steps To Reproduce:
1. add java.lang.Math to the static imports
2. make sure the content sort by order is set to relevance
3. create a project which imports the JUnit library
4. add the following class:
import junit.framework.TestCase;

public class Foo extends TestCase {
	protected void foo() {
		int selection= 0;
		assertEquals(1, s);
	}
}

observe: when pressing ctrl-space after "s" in the assertEquals(1, s) line to fix the compile error, some static imports from j.l.Math are shown before the local variable "selection"
