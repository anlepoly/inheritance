BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
The compiler is supposed to use only 1.4 libraries, but these libraries don't
support the Unicode 4 specifications.
In order to compile 1.5 code that are using UTF-16 characters, we need to
emulatate the Unicode 4 using 1.4 libraries.
Fixed and released in HEAD.
The scanner now checks if the extended character are valid characters inside an
identifier. We don't retrieve the property for each character.
