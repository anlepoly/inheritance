BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Using HEAD.
I have following test case:
class X<T> {
}
class Y<E> extends X<E> {
  X<E> y1;
  X<E> y2;
}

Put cursor inside X<E> in Y declaration and serahc for references in project =>
an IllegalArgumentException occurs in Util.scanTypeSignature(...)
Fixed.

Problem came from changes done in uniqueKey of ParameterizedSourceType. Modify
select engine to put only signatures information in ParameterizedSource* classes.

Currently only tests in ResolveTests_1_5 have been modified to take into account
changes done in selection engine.

I'll add a specific test for scenario described in comment 0...
Test case #testParameterizedType_Bug83713 added in JavaSearchGenericTypeTests
Verified in I20050214-0927 for 3.1.M5
