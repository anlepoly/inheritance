BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
ImportRewrite#newAnnotationValue(..) had the problem from comment 28 as well, e.g for member value pair "state= Thread.State.BLOCKED".

The new API ITypeBinding#getTypeAnnotationsOnDimensions() was unnecessary, and I've reverted those changes. Type annotations on dimensions can already be accessed via getComponentType().

I've also reverted/fixed some of the Javadoc changes. The addImport methods can also produce parameterized types, array types, or annotated types, so it is wrong to just say they return either a simple name or a qualified name.

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?id=8771cbd26402d5e088df5bc8e18f1b0e8d601818
