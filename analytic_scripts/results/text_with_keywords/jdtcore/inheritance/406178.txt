BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Fix and tests released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=89326fe08eb871063f0f302034a5879455c90920.

The patch also includes a fix for similar problem with raw types.

However, since bridge methods are not emitted as of now, code
generation will still produce incorrect results: Raised https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=406181 for this.
