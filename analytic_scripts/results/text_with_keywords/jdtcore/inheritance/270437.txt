BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Version: 3.5.0
Build id: I20090313-0100

1. Test case: 
public class TestClass extends TestClass.Inn|{
  public class Inner {}
}

2. At the '|' symbol do CTRL+Space

3. 'TestClass.Inn' gets completed to TestClass.Inner - 
which is wrong since it leads to an error:

"Cycle detected: the type TestClass cannot extend/implement
itself or one of its own member types"

The same issue is applicable to interfaces as well. That is, inner/member interfaces are offered as completion choices for implements too.

The attached code patch fixes both the issues - the originally reported extends issue and the one I noticed about implements as well.

The attached test patch has two tests to verify the two prob
