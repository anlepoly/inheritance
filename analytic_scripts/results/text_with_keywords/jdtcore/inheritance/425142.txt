BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
We were creating a type constraint from the type of an unresolved lambda.
That's where null comes into play and later explodes.

Fix consists of two steps:

- don't assume resolved when this.shapeAnalysisComplete is set

- add missing  FE.getExpressionContext() (was constantly answering 
  VANILLA_CONTEXT from Statement.getExpressionContext() )
