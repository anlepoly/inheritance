BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
For this test case it actually suffices to separately record inference solutions per target type to determine if invocation type inference must be rerun.

More to follow in bug 426290.

Fix has been released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=ae0b30b76dcbe89d5bd08d53d907ae7218823168
