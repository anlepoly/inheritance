BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
One test has already been released via commit 97b509ed0492c1ec5d604a591a307ac7d4bc5ef4
(passing).

I'm adding another one (using null annotations) via commit 926127edb74c4e9bf214c4a80335d01c8995a448

Bug 392099 and friends have brought many changes, I'm no longer able to reconstruct even how we got into the NPE. Too bad we didn't record the stack trace ...
