BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
build I20040930

1) create X.java
public X <T> {
  void foo() {
    W<? extends Stri^> s;
  }
}

2) do ctrl + space at ^ location

No completion (String could be proposed)
CompletionParser ast is not complete (missing completion node).

public class W<T> {
  public W() {
  }
  void foo() {
  }
}
Fixed and test added
  GenericsCompletionParserTest#test0184()
