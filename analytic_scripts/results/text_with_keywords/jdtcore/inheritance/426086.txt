BUG TITLE:
[1.8] LambdaConversionException when method reference to an inherited method is invoked from sub class

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Thanks Jay, we were incorrectly massaging the signature to the "compatible type",
which is wrong since private methods cannot be inherited and the signature
should encode only the receiver type.

Fix and tests available here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=a9a745d3dc8adaa654d6924765178874380c9a20
