BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
The fix basically consists of

- converting polyExpressionSeen from a local to a field "innersNeedUpdate"
  (of all Invocations) and taking care that this flag is only ever reset,
  when final resolving has actually happened

- invoking ASTNode.resolvePolyExpressionArguments on one more path

- better distinguish work to be done in states TYPE_INFERRED vs.
  BINDINGS_UPDATED
