BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I get the following error when using content assist on this test case:

Content Assist: Disabling the "org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaNoTypeCompletionProposalComputer" (org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaNoTypeCompletionProposalComputer) extension to the "javaCompletionProposalComputer" extension point. Reason: The extension has thrown a runtime exception.

Here is the test case:

import java.util.HashMap;

public class Test1 {

	<T> HashMap
}

To reproduce, place the cursor after HashMap, invoke Content Assist (CTRL+SPACE), and choose the first suggestion.  There is an exception thrown in 3.1.1 as well, but the error message is different.
Oops, forgot to say I'm using version 3.2M4 (I20051215-1506) with GTK2.
We will yet change the way we react to a failure in a completion proposal computer.

The underlying exception is in jdt-core, see below; moving to jdt-core.
