BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
When writing an annontation and trying to use content assist on 'this', org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaNoTypeCompletionProposalComputer throws a runtime exception.

Example:

@Description("Some description for " + this.getName())
                                           ^
Using content assist will cause runtime exception here.

Of course, one should not use 'this' in such a situation, but a proper error message should be displayed instead of the runtime exception dialog.
