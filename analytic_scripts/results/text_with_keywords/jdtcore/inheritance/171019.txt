BUG TITLE:
[javadoc][select] F3 on {@inheritDoc} tag should navigate to target javadoc

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
It would be nice if it was possible to navigate through the inherited method through the {@inheritDoc} tag when present in a javadoc comment.

For example in following test case
public class Y extends X {
X.java:
    public class X {
	/**
	 * Main description of the method foo...
	 *
	 * @param obj The given object
	 * @return an empty string
	 * @see Object the root class
	 * @see String the string class
	 */
	public String foo(Object obj) {
		return "";
	}
    }

Y.java:
    public class Y extends X {
	/**
	 * Specific description of the overriding method...
	 *<br>
	 * {@inheritDoc}
	 * @return <code>null</code>
	 */
	public String foo(Object obj) {
		return null;
	}
    }

I expect to jump to X.foo javadoc comment when hitting F3 on the {@inheritDoc] inline tag...
Not sure if there was any changes need in JDT/UI for this or only return the correct selected element would be enough?

Should also check hyperlinking (Ctrl+click) in the Java editor when codeSelect works.

I'd like to see this fixed for 3.7.
I'll follow up.
