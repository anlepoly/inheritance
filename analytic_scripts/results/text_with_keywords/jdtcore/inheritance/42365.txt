BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
1) create the x.jar file with the following classes
I.class
public interface I {
	void foo();
}

X.class
public abstract class X implements I{

}

Y.class
public class Y extends X {
	public void foo() {
	}
}
2) attache source file to this jar
3) create the following class
Z.java
public class Z {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Y y = new Y();
		((X)y).foo();//select foo
	}
}
4) select 'foo' in the commented line
5) do F3

X.class is selected but it must be I.class

The problem does not happen if I, X and Y are in source file.
The problem does not occurs in build 20031211

Test added (ResolveTests#testMethodDeclarationInInterface)

Fixed.
Verified with build I200312160010
