BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Types which appear as values in annotation elements within binary types are surfacing as unresolved bindings, even after they have otherwise been resolved.

That is, if an annotation like @Anno(IFoo.class) shows up on a type in a jar file, when APT tries to read the annotation value it gets a TypeBinding that is internally represented with an UnresolvedReferenceBinding and therefore gives wrong answers to questions like isInterface() or getQualifiedName().

The attached repro case consists of the following:

  1. annoval-binary.jar contains an interface definition, an annotation definition with an element of type Class, and some base classes A and B which are annotated with the annotation.

  2. anno-val.zip, which is a plug-in project that creates an annotation processor.

  3. anno-val-target.zip, which is a Java project that declares a class C that extends B and that is annotated.  This project needs annoval-binary.jar to be on  its classpath.

To reproduce the problem, import the anno-val project into a h
