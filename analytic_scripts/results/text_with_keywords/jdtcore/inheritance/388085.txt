BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
The changes done in the grammar and parser are rendered obsolete by
the fix for bug 390784.

I retained the changes in Wildcard.java with minor modifications[*] and
also released the tests -- Thanks Jay !

[*] No need to introduce wildcardAnnotations field in Wildcard.
Wildcard being a TypeReference inherits the 'annotations' field from 
the super class.

Fix and test released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=e0048708b1f289d431c0dd85e7c6b6e3c3eaa0d5
