BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Try this code:

	class Base {
		public Base(String foo) {
		}
	}

	class SubClass extends Base {
		public SubClass() {
			System.out.println("a statement");
			super("bar");
		}
	}

The error reported is:
Syntax error on token "(", "." expected	SubClass.java

The javac error is (more helpful):
SubClass.java:5: call to super must be first statement in constructor super("bar");
David - can the syntax recovery handle this one ? Alternatively, we could make 
our grammar less strict, and check this situation after the fact.
Fixed.
Verified.
