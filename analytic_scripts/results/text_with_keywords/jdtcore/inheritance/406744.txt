BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Fix and tests released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=0b6cbc7336ec44b9257b7aa04e8ba2a7e4c8be56

This is essentially the same as the "Proposed patch" with 3 differences:

    - Fixed a wrong check ReferenceExpression.manageSyntheticAccessIfNecessary
    - Added a test to establish that the above is necessary and sufficient.
    - Eliminated potential double reporting of errors/warnings during flow
      analysis. 

The approach exemplified by this patch could perhaps be used for all situations
that require synthetics, not just variable arity methods, but it will incur
a bit of runtime overhead ([implicit lambda -> bridge -> target] as opposed to
[bridge -> target].
