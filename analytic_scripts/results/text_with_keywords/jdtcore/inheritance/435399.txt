> @Stephan : Isn't it why we have "source level"?

Example where source level 1.7 and JRE 8 get you into a grey area: default methods. How should a compiler configured for 1.7 handle a source file that implements a 1.8 interface containing default methods? At source level 1.7 the compiler by definition doesn't know about default methods. So?

The other obvious problem: compilation will not detect when you are trying to invoke API from JRE 8, which will not be present when running on JRE 7. OTOH, if you want to run the application on JRE 8 anyway, what's the use in setting source 1.7?

Note, that installing the JREs for all relevant versions suffices, no need to have the full JDK.
