When renaming a class which has a superclass containing an inner class, the type references to the inner class (qualified through the subclass) don't get updated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Import project 'foo' from the attached zip file.
2. Rename class 'Foo'.
3. Note that 'Foo.Bar' reference in class 'Main' was not updated.
Created an attachment (id=154466)
Zipped test project
Can reproduce with I20100107-1410.
The search engine does not find the reference to type Foo in 'new Foo.Bar();'. Also does not work here: 'foo.Foo.Bar bar;'.

Looks similar to bug 204118. Crucial point seems to be that Bar is not declared inside Foo, but inside _Foo, which is a supertype of Foo.
