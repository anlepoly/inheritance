BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I don't think this a known limitation. Could be fixed in a separate bug if somebody cared enough. This is not a new problem and requires a malicious user.

The call to validateEdit should be pulled to the beginning of SetClasspathOperation#executeOperation(), guarded with this.canChangeResources and the other checks on rscFile in JavaProject#setSharedProperty(..), and the operation should throw a JME if the validation failed.
