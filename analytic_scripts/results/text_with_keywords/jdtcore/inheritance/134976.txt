BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
build 3.2M6

------------------------------------------------------------------
public class SerializableList extends LinkedList<Serializable|> {
}
------------------------------------------------------------------

Do ctrl + space at | location and will see that SerializableList is on the top of the proposal list and it should be Serializable
The expceted type is Object and the type in the current compilation SerializableList is a subclass of Object. Serializable is found by searchAllType() but in this case type hierarchies are not computed  (it would be too costly), so Serializable isn't considered as a subclass of Object.

That's why the relevance of SerializableList is higher than relevance of Serializable.

If expected type is Object we should consider all types proposed by searchAllType() as subclasses.
