Manoj is caught between a rock and a hard place with there being two
reviewers :) - Sorry for subjecting you to pulls in different directions. 

I don't fully agree with the point about regularity(regularness ?), but it 
is not a strong enough disagreement that I can leave it as is.

There is a general belief that programmers are poor judges of program hotspots
and sometimes come up with contorted code full of micro-optimizations with
the aim of improving performance where there is no real benefit. While that
sort of "optimizations" should be avoided, the case at hand is not that.
