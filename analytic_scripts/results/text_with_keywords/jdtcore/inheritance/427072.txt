BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Fix and tests released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=e6d1c8eac73b65997182b9feaba7e190099afd1a.

Note to self: Write junits for even obviously correctly functioning code,
not just for where we need to discriminate based on the new spec :(
