BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
(these regressions are responsible for failing refactoring tests in 20030107)

package p;
class A{
   A A;
   A A(A A){
	 A:
		for (;;){
		  if (A.A(A)==A)
			 break A;
		}
	  return A;
   };
}
stupid bugzilla - lost the rest of the report

the rest went like this:

20030107 found (correctly) 3 references to A
20030114 found 4 more (bogus) references (marked as inexact)
more cases:

package p;
class A{
   boolean A = new A() instanceof A;
   A A(A A){
     A:
        for (;;){
          if (A.A(A)==A)
             break A;
        }
      return A;
   };
}
class AA extends A{
   A A = (A) new A();
   A A(A A){
     A:
        for (;;){
          if (A.A(A)==A)
             break A;
        }
      return A;
   };
}
(can't believe it - it lost it again!)
20030107 found (correctly) 3 references to A

package p;
public class A {
	A(A A){}
	A A(A A){
		A= new A(new A(A));
		return A;
	}
}
(it lost it again! or maybe it's the linux thing)
anyway- here's
