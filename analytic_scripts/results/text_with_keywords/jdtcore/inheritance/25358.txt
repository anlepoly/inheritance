BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I have the junit jar file as part of the workbench classpath. When I try to 
create a new java class, and I click on the "Browse" button for the parent, I 
get a dialog box. In this I type "testcase" and the junit.framework.TestCase 
class does not show up in the list of selectable classes.
I am running M2 - and this was working in M1.
Martin, was this behaviour changed intentionally?
No there was no change in M2 for this.

bwt, what do you mean by 'parent'. Superclass?
Note that for enclosing type the dialog only shows types that are available in 
source (not from a JAR)
Yes I do mean the superclass.
I am not sure what you mean by "not from a jar" - since the 
junit.framework.TestCase class used to appear in previous versions.
The superclass dilaog should show the class.
I can;t reproduce it , it works in my workspace. I suspect that the indexer is 
the problem. 
If you enter junit.framework.TestCase by typing, does it warn you that the 
class doesn't exist?
