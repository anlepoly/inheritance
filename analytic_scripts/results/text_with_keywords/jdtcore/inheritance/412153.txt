I released support for the deprecation warning via: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=3c8db8654fc8e2927c75863ec1232c9bc3800c9b

Raised https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=419331 for the
forward reference issue - this is not connected to JEP120 support.
