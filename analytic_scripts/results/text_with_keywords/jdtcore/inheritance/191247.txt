BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
3.3 RC3.

Binary compatibility breakage: run(Object) got removed from AptBuilder which is public API and it no longer inherits from IPlatformRunnable which is another breakage.
AptBuilder is the run class used for the application declared in plugin.xml and not used elsewhere. I would
1. copy current AptBuilder to an internal package and update plugin.xml
2. restore the API AptBuilder from 3.2
3. deprecate it the API
As long as the application cannot be instantiated, I don't see why this is a breakage.
run(Object) is used by the Eclipse runtime. The runtime is also responsible to instantiate the application.
The class is in an API package and does not contain the disclaimer that it is not to be instantiated by clients. Neither do the implemented interfaces contain such a disclaimer.
I think we can't fix the binary compatibility with 3.2 without breaking binary compatibility with 3.3 milestone releases.  It seems that maybe the best thing would be just to add disclaimers?  It seems a bit unlikely that anyone ha
