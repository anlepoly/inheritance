BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
In AssistParser, we were recognizing that we are inside a lambda expression
a little later than we should - as a result explicit parameters were not
recovered as nodes belonging to lambda.

Fix and tests here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=4c94b3d7ef7a5503607858476a6477496a59c95b
