BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Build ID: M20071023-1652

Steps To Reproduce:
1. add EasyMock and EasyMock Class Extension to your projects' libraries (http://www.easymock.org)
2. under Window/Preferences/Java/Editor/Content Assist/Favorites add new types org.easymock.EasyMock and org.easymock.classextension.EasyMock
3. create a class, write a main method (f.e.) and type "replay" and press ctrl space to start content assist
4. Only one Method "replay(Object... mocks) void - EasyMock" is shown, both types configured above have a method matching this, but you can't choose between them since there is only one row

More information:
org.easymock.EasyMock is choosen, but there is no possibility to change this but changing the generated import statement by hand.

When writing Tests with EasyMock you sometimes need the classextension and sometimes not, so you should choose
when writing the actual test.

The bug in eclipse makes this unnecessarily hard.
Simple test case:
1) create test/p/ZZZA.java
package test.p;
public class ZZZA {
    public stat
