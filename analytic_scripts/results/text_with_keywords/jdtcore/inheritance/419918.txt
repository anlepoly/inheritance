BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Fix and tests released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=01c814e6bd45b7fbd49eec3a490338a17c21d9fb

I noticed that in TAW, matches is a long while the mask that is used
to light the bits in matches is an int. Changed it. Don't expect it to
actually fix anything :)

One part of the fix may not actually be correct: I am arranging so that
the constructor result type annotations are attributed to the constructor.
This may require rework.
