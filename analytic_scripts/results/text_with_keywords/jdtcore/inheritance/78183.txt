TypeBinding#getQualifiedName() doesn't do what its Javadocs promise.
Differences I found:

- #getQualifiedName() does not include type arguments, although the Javadoc says
it should. #getName() already includes type arguments as well as type
parameters, which suggests that #getQualifiedName() should also include both.

- #getQualifiedName() for List's type argument in 'List<? extends Object>'
returns 'java.util.? extends Object' instead of '? extends java.lang.Object'
- #getQualifiedName() for type variables is undefined
Jim, could you please specify what is expected for the type variables?
Because we are in the bindings' world, I think for:
class X<T>

we should have:
X<T extends java.lang.Object>

Move it back to me when the spec is updated. I will take care of the implementation.
Type variables are covered by the actual documentation.
	 * <li>For type variables, the fully qualified name is just the name of the
	 * type variable (type bounds are not included).
	 * Example: <code>"X"</code>.</
