BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
When typing the "throws" of a method declaration and using code assist to pick 
the correct Throwable class, the code assist shows ALL classes that match the 
letters you've entered.  This is incorrect.  You can only declare Throwable and 
its subclasses.  The code assist list should filter out all other classes.  

Example:

public void calculate(String value) throws Num

In the above example, if the cursor is sitting right after the "Num" and you 
press CTRL-Space, you get the code assist list that contains all classes 
like "Number", however code assist should be smart enough to know that the 
Number class is not a subclass of Throwable, and therefore is not a valid 
selection given the context.
if the subtype hierarchy of Throwable computation is too expensive, could we 
use the relevance support to give types ending with Exception, Error, Failure a 
higher relevance in this context?
Relevance for exception types should already be in (type name ending with 
Exception or Error).

David - please double chec
