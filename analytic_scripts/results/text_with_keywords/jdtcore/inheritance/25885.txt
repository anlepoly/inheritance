BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
1) create class X1
public classs X1 {}
2) create class X2
public class X2 extends X1 {}
3) create class Y
public class Y {
   X2 var1;
   X1 var2;
   X1 foo() {
      return var<cursor>
   }
}
4) do ctrl+space at cursor location
'var1' is on the top of the completions list. I'd like to see 'var2' as first 
proposal.
Fixed.
Verified.
