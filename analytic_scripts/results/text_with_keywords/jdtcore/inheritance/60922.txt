BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
The specs for classpath container initializers (subclasses of 
ClasspathContainerInitializer) and classpath containers (implementations of 
IClasspathContainer) should spell out the restricted subset of the JDT Core 
APIs that can be safely used.
Created an attachment (id=10269)
patch to improve specs

Philippe, Please review (especially the list of APIs that it's ok for client to
use).
We should still add some protection, see bug 61040.
Looks good to me; especially the *unspecified* behavior for other cases.
Thanks.  I've released.
Verified in 200405180816.
The javadoc in the patch is invalid (missing end of inline tag).
Open bug 62769 to address this issue.
