BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
When a type implements an interface that is already implemented by one of its supertypes, then the declaration in the subtype is superfluous. The compiler could flag this as unnecessarily implemented interface.

interface I { }
class A implements I { }
class B extends A implements I { } // "implements I" is unnecessary
