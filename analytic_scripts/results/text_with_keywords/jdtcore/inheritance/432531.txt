BUG TITLE:
[1.8] VerifyError with anonymous subclass inside of lambda expression in the superclass constructor call

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Two observations: 

(1) We should never add a test whose output differs from the reference 
compiler's output unless we are very sure we are right and javac is wrong. 
Test LE.test432531a is encoding wrong behavior. I have moved it to be a negative
test with https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=433735 being fixed.

(2) The current treatment of anonymous classes brought in by the present fix
is not totally accurate. Per 15.9.5.1 we should be looking at superbinding to
see if it is one of enclosing types to see if the lambda should capture instance.
However, I am willing/inclined to leave it as is as I think field/method access and/or emulation path should catch these problems.

Sorry I didn't catch these earlier.
