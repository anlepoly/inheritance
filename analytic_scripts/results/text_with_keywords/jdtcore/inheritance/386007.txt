The converter tests (tests that extend ConverterTestSetup) use couple of static fields to avoid configuration of test projects multiple times and clearing them for every test suite. I have added the code to do similar thing in RunAllJava8Tests. The test suite is working fine now.

I also noticed that RunAllJava8Tests has some issues with JUnit 4 - Some tests are marked as Unrooted tests, even though the tests themselves are run alright. For some reason, Junit 4 sees the converter tests with different root than the other tests. I could be wrong, but one possible explanation is that the converter tests have org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.junit.extension.TestCase  in their hierarchy. I am leaving the tests as they are now as they are fine with Junit 3. But eventually when Junit 3 is deprecated and removed from the UI, we will have to revisit this.
