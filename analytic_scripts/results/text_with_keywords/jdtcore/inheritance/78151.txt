BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
200410260800

- Have a new CU New.java:
    public class New extends /*caret*/ { }

- Press Ctrl+Space with the cursor at the indicated location.
=> Was: 'New' is inserted.
=> Expected: Proposal popup with single completion is shown, even if 'Insert
single proposals automatically' is checked.
It should not suggest New here.
+ 2 from me
The current behaviour is not consistent. Code assist should suggest either all 
types or no types. The current way of just showing known enclosing types leads 
to lots of strange completions where 99% are not wanted)
e.g. see bug 76674 comment 5 and following

Even better would be a flag to specify to get all types if we want (of course 
not for showing in the UI, but when code assist is used programmatically)
Fixed and test added
  CompletionTests#testCompletionInsideExtends1() ->
CompletionTests#testCompletionInsideExtends12()

Current type and members of this type must not be proposed after 'extends' or
'implements'.
