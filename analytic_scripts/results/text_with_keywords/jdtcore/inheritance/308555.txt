BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Build Identifier: org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core_3.3.101.R34x_v20090114-1205.jar

If a user has custom project settings for annotations, then a .factorypath file is created.  If the user then shares that project with a repository system (like CVS) then a dialog shows up asking the user the type of content for that file extension.  The user shouldn't have to choose, as this is clearly a text file, and it could confuse the user by asking this question.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See details section.
I suppose I could mention that this extension element will fix the problem:
    <extension point="org.eclipse.team.core.fileTypes">
        <fileTypes extension="factorypath" type="text"/>
    </extension>
Nice improvement - thanks.
Fixed for 3.6 M7.
Verified for 3.6M7 using I20100425-2000
