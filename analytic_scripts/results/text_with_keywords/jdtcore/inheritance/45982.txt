BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I am using I20030917 with the Sun SDK 1.4.2_02.

I was editing a new Java file - see below - and I got a popup saying that an 
error had occurred and I should check the Eclipse log. The error occurred 
while I was trying to type the word ArrayList.

    public CliSource(Array) <<<========= Error happened here
    {
        super();
        // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
    }
}

The stack dump from the Eclipse log follows
