BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Patch looks good. Fix and tests released via: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=97e97b88721b4de5a807118c9ff5efc5e22e05aa.

Thanks Anirban.

A few more points to note in future:

1. Ensure that all modified files have upto date copyright. I fixed the ones
that still said 2012. The easiest way to do this is to install the copyright
update plugin.

2. All modified files on BETA_JAVA8 branch must have the disclaimer in
the copyright that reads:

* This is an implementation of an early-draft specification developed under the Java
 * Community Process (JCP) and is made available for testing and evaluation purposes
 * only. The code is not compatible with any specification of the JCP.
 * 
I fixed a couple of files that were missing this.

3. We typically prefix a test with the bug link and bug title.
