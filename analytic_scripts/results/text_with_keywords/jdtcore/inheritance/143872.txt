BUG TITLE:
annotationProcessorFactory extension point schema incomplete

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
N20060525-0010

The schema for org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core's annotationProcessorFactory extension point is incomplete (and maybe even wrong):

* 'factory > class' attribute should have:
- Type: 'java' (not 'string') and
- Extends: 'com.sun.mirror.apt.AnnotationProcessorFactory'

Without these meta attributes, PDE cannot properly support contributors:
- 'Rename Type' refactorings and Java search don't find/update references in plugin.xml
- no validation of contributed processor factory classes
- no help for creating new processor factories

* 'factory > class' is optional -> shouldn't it be required?
* 'factory > implements' does not seem to be used for anything -> remove?
* boilerplate "[Enter description of ..." and empty documentation in a few places
Walter, can you put together a patch for this?

Here's a patch for annotationProcessorFactory.  I notice that the same comments apply to o.e.jdt.core.compilationParticipant.exsd; I will open a separa
