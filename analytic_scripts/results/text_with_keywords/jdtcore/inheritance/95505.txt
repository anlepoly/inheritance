BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Eclipse 3.1 M7

It was very convinient in Eclipse that when it already knows type and I write
"new " and press Ctrl+Space, it shows this type. For example:

	button.addActionListener(new {cursor})

But in M7 I have now look, what type should be used and write several first
letters? Why? Please return old behaviour, at least make this optional.
I like it better the way it is now, as often I did not want to instantiate the
declared type, but a subtype of it.

Thats right. Completion should offer list of subclasses too!

But actually it offers nothing until you press a key. It should display the
declared type and its known subtype
