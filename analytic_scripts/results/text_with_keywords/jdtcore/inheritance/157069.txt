BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
package a;

public class A {
    protected class Sub {}
    protected void doSomething(Sub sub){}
}

----------
package b;

public class B extends A {
doSome<<CARET>>
}

----------

The code above describes the scenario.  When you invoke content assist in class B (where the caret is) to override the doSomething() method, an invalid import statement for a.A.Sub is added to class B.  That import statement is not necessary.
There's no proposal with your test case...

You need to modify B.java compilation unit as follows:
----------
package b;

public class B extends a.A {
doSome<<CARET>>
}
----------
Is this a regression of bug 20562

Proposed fix


Released for 3.4M1

Tests added :
  CompletionTests#testCompletionMethodDeclaration13() -> testCompletionMethodDeclaration16()
Hmm, I'm annoying with this one as I must reopen it...

The symptom described at comment 0 still exists but it's a fact that the completion proposal given by JDT/Core does no longer qualify the parameter type a
