BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I20080604-2000

On the following test case, Eclipse complains that i may remain uninitialized, while javac is silent:
public class X {
  final int i;
  X() {
	if (true) {
	  throw new NullPointerException();
	}
  }
}

Note that both keep quiet on the following:

public class X {
  X() {
	final int i;
	if (true) {
	  throw new NullPointerException();
	}
	System.out.println(i);
  }
}

Added FlowAnalysisTest#50 & 51.
class Y {
	Y(Object o) {
	}
}
public class X extends Y {
	final int blank;
 {
    if (true)
        throw new NullPointerException();
 }
 X() {
    super(new Object() {});     
 }
}

elicits an error from us, but not from javac (5/6/7)

This behavior is codified by us in org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.compiler.regression.FlowAnalysisTest.test031()
