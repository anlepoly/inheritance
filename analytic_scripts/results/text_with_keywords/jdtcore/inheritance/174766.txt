BUG TITLE:
[1.5][compiler] Cannot create member class that extends an exception inside a generic class

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Using v_737, this code doesn't compile.
It compiles fine using javac 1.5.0._11.

public class X<T> {
  public class C extends Exception {}
}

We report:
----------
1. ERROR in d:\tests_sources\X.java (at line 2)
	public class C extends Exception {}
	                       ^^^^^^^^^
The generic class X<T>.C may not subclass java.lang.Throwable

It fails with jdk6_01 b03 though.
Will investigate.
I wonder if it is a bug in JDT or one in the JDK's javac though. It seems quite intentional that this is not allowed:

    public class MyException<T> extends RuntimeException
    {
    }

So if the following were allowed, it would be possible to use T within the Exception, and I think that's why the above is not allowed.

    public class X<T>
    {
      public class MyException extends RuntimeException
      {
        T getT()
        {
          return null;
        }
      }
    }

Probably you guys are just doing a better job than javac.
This behavior is described in the spec, could
