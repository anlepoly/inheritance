BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Fix released via commit 5abbc9ddba0809fbf49d16dc724883e6fc17121c

Here's what I ended up doing:
* split ReconcilerTests.testMethodWithError01() into two:
  - one with adjusted expectation
  - one with tweaked input to meet the old expectation
* adjust expectation in GenericDietRecoveryTest.test0025()
  - do expect recovery of the modifier "public"
* change Parser as to handle modifier flags during recovery even if annotationRecoveryActivated is false
  -> this makes CompletionParser consistent with the regular parser after the change in bug 383973.
* added overriding CompletionParser.consumePushCombineModifiers() to mimic a corresponding override of checkAndSetModifiers()
  -> establish consistency regarding CompletionParser#hasUnusedModifiers, proof by intuition :)
* run all JDT/Core tests
