BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I've verified for 4.3 M3 that:

- the change in StackMapAttributeTest.test011() makes sense.

- the examples from comment 1 and comment 11 produce the results mentioned here
  both using HEAD from master and using ecj-I20121029-2000.jar

Note, that the original commit did not contain any new regression tests.
I've added these and released for posterity via commit 30a87361ca1a3810d60c69d18b1e1fb90c3948ab
