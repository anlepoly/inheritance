BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
1. Create a blank workspace.
2. Create a Class Test
3. type foo and use ctrl-space for automatic creation of method
Before this formatting option was active the comment would have indented to the method body which looked very nice imho.
Now the comment is right at the beginning and does not get indented which looks strange for automatically generated bodies especially if the indention is quite high.
Also the indention is correct for automatically generated comments in ctrl-space for overriden methods
public class Test5 {
	public static class InnerClass {
		private void foo() {
// TODO Auto-generated method stub
			new Runnable() {
			
				@Override
				public void run() {
					// TODO Auto-generated method stub
			
				}
			
			};
		}
	}
}
You are right, that's quite big problem also for the ASTRewriter.
We have to disable the option when formatting generated code or string placeholders passed to the AST rewrite.
There is nothing I can do at the code formatter level.
Daniel requested to get the new option tru
