BUG TITLE:
[1.5][compiler] improve message on nameclash when overriding method with "wildcard" parameter

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Build ID: I20061102-1715

Steps To Reproduce:
Try to compile the following source code, with compiler compliance level set to 5.0:

import java.util.List;

class Super<T> {
  public void accepts(final List<?> list) {
  }
}

class Sub extends Super {
  public void accepts(final List<?> list) {
    super.accepts(list);
  }
}

You will get the compiler error:

Name clash: The method accepts(List<?>) of type Sub has the same erasure as accepts(List<?>) of type Super<T> but does not override it


More information:
The code compiles fine when you remove the generic type parameter T from the Super class.
javac agrees with us on this test case (1.5.10 and 6 b104, not tested b105
yet).
Released GenericTypeTest#test1100 in HEAD and R3_2_maintenance.
Sorry for not trying with javac first...

So are you saying that it is the correct behaviour according to the Java specification, or that it is a Sun bug that Eclipse emulates?
So far, I simply looked at javac and did not give much thought to the spec. I'll have a second lo
