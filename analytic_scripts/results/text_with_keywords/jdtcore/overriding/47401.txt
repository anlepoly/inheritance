BUG REPORT COMMENTS:

1. 	public void runTest() {

		Thread t= new Thread() {
                        | code assist here 
			public void run() {
			}
		};
		t.start();
	}

Code assist at the given method suggests to override 'Thread.activeCount()'

Anonymous methods can not have static methods.
It's also questionable if static methods should be offered to override anyway.
CodeAssist should not suggest static methods for anonymous, local and non 
static member types.

In other case, static method should be suggested but with a lesser relevance 
than non static methods.
Fixed and tests added (CompletionTests#testCompletionStaticMethodDeclarationX)
Verified with build I200312160010
