BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Thanks for the updates.

The difference between versions 1.1.x and 2.0.x of the annotation bundle is: the former are SE5 style annotations, whereas the latter are SE8 *type annotations* (see the @Target(TYPE_USE) meta annotation).

Some background is actually documented in the help, see: http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-using_null_type_annotations.htm#compatibility

The combination compliance 1.8 and SE5-style annotations is known to have some problems. I'll see what I can do for Mars.
