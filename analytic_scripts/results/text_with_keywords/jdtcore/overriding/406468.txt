BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I made some simplifications:

    - Renamed inReferenceExpressionScope to be inReferenceExpression since these
constructs do not introduce a scope per se.
    - Localized the management of this state variable to CompletionParser.
There is no need for the main parser to be involved in what is only a completion
issue.
    - Centralized the state management by introducing a new override in 
CompletionParser rather than have the state managed in 4 different places.
    - Restructured the switch just a little bit to minimize the diffs and
have the delta stand out.

Released fix and test here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=f0cc0529135fe43e5b6252dca937651f0a04d49c

Thanks Anirban.
