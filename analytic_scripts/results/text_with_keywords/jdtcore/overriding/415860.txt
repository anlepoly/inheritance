BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Earlier, I thought there is no way for our tests to override the 1.6 level that is set as default. But I figured there is a way the tests can override this by just adding "-1.8" to the options before invoking the compiler.

So, I guess we don't need do anything here, at least for the time being.
