BUG TITLE:
[content assist] wrong method created when overriding static method

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Eclipse build id:I20050627-1435

steps to reproduce:
create some class with method main. 
create another class that extends first class.
type "main" in class body, press ctrl-space for content assistant choose there
"main - main method".
method toString is created.
Your scenario works for me but when I select:
main(Stting[] args) void - Override method in 'A'
it inserts a wrong proposal
it's exactly what I mean. 
codeComplete should not propose the proposal since static methods can't be
overridden in a OO-sense.
Yes, but I still can create method main, so it should be possible to create
method main with codeComlete.
sure. that's why there's the main template.
yes, I see.
Fixed and tests updated.
