BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
The Sun apt tool implementation of the overrides() method in this interface returns true when the first parameter 'sub' denotes a concrete method that implements the second parameter 'sup' that is method defined in an interface. The JDT APT tool in eclipse returns false. Judging by the javadoc comment in the API (reproduced below), I'm assuming the Sun apt tool has the correct behavior:

"When a non-abstract method overrides an abstract one, the former is also said to implement the latter."
Assigning to Tim Hanson. Tim, do you think this is related to the different type universes from JDT?
Sounds like it is a a multi-verse bug.

Doug, can you post a small sample that demonstrates the problem?

For example:

abstract class MyIterator implements Iterator {

    @Implement(Iterator.class)
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return false;
    }
}

I have an annotation processor that checks whether the above hasNext() method actually implements a method in java.utilIterator. It uses the com.sun.mirror AST to ge
