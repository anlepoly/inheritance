BUG TITLE:
DefaultASTVisitor doesn't override all methods

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I20070403

DefaultASTVisitor doesn't override all methods (e.g. it doesn't override visit(MarkerAnnotation). As a consequence, visitNode(ASTNode) and endVisitNode(ASTNode) are not called for all nodes in the AST.
Created an attachment (id=63764)
Proposed fix

Override all methods but visit(Modifier) and endVisit(Modifier) as we don't want to associate a comment with a modifier (ASTRewritingMethodDeclTest#testMethodReturnTypeChange2AST3() would fail).
