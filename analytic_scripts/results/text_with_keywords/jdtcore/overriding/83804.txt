BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
20050127

Look at the AST of the following code:
The package declaration should have the Javadoc node set (new in 5.0)

/**
 * 
 */
package pack;

public class E {

}
I think the bug needs some more explanation. As there is only one file from 
which the documentation about the package should be taken, which should be 
called "package-info.java". Otherwise several .java files could override the 
package-javadoc.

Example source (package-info.java):

/**
 * Provides the classes necessary to create an applet and the classes an  
applet uses
 * to communicate with its applet context.
 * <p>
 * The applet framework involves two entities:
 * the applet and the applet context. An applet is an embeddable window  
(see the
 * {@link java.awt.Panel} class) with a few extra methods that the applet  
context
 * can use to initialize, start, and stop the applet.
 *
 * @since 1.0
 * @see java.awt
