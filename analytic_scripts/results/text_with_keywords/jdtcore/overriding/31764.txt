BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Build 20030211

Looking at the problem factory defined in CompletionEngine constructor,
it appears not to forward errors to the requestor (since it overrides an
obsolete method).

Thus UI has no chance to display an informative message in case no completion 
was computed.

Need to investigate if we want to resurrect this behavior at this stage (is it 
causing grief to UI).

This feels like it got broken quite a while ago.
SelectionEngine has same bug.

Behavior should be to filter out warnings and syntax errors (since heavy on 
recovery).

Need to ensure that UI is only displaying errors if no completion is available 
(or should we only feed errors if no completion is available). In this case we 
should only feed the first found error.
Martin - do you have an opinion on this ? Currently your completion requestor 
will never get any error notification. By glancing at your implementation, it 
seems to only show errors if completions were available, which seems to be 
exactly the opposite of what we would expect
