BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Resolved via commit dd3bff4d99a5193497eb7e3c0e1bc46a32b7c36a
- in 1.7- modes all interface methods are now considered as abstract
- additionally, when overriding a default method AccImplementing is now used, so that reporting for these cases is covered by OPTION_ReportMissingOverrideAnnotationForInterfaceMethodImplementation.

With this implementation, the change from bug 388800 comment 1 (commit 4da3045d875134bb37de1ca00076288feb78d111) had to be reverted and I started walking in the opposite direction instead. As a result this patch contains the major leg work for bug 388800, too, do be documented there.
