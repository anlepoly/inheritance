> We should actually use TypeBinding#genericTypeSignature() here.

This also needs to be applied for this bug. The lesson learned is that you can't convert Binding#readableName() to a resolved signature without information loss. For unresolved signatures, writing "QT;" for a reference to a type variable T is fine. For a resolved signature, "LT;" is wrong. It needs to be "TT;".

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?id=c5d3e87bb720e91660c058962146e02390cfc415 and also in BETA_JAVA8 branch.
