BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
During our exploration at the DSRG of integrating JML with Eclipse, we found that OperatorExpression.nullStatus(FlowInfo) should return NON_NULL instead of UNKNOWN: no operators other than the conditional operator can produce a null result, and that case is covered by an overriding method in ConditionalExpression.
Created an attachment (id=54268)
patch for OperatorExpression.nullStatus()

proposed fix.
You're right, thanks for the heads up. Found a test case that is broken by the current code:
public class X {
  void foo() {
    int j = 5;    Integer i = 0 + j;
    if (i == null) {} // should complain here but does not
  }
}


Added NullReferenceTest#45.

Released for 3.3 M4.
Verified for 3.3M4 with I20061211-1119
