BUG TITLE:
Remember to remove "SYSTEM" override, once JavaSE-1.8 is supported

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Sorry for the slow response, bug a) just demonstrates how swamped I've been :) and b) hard to find in a bug unrelated to testing. So, I opened bug 429571 to track the "testing of BETA_JAVA8 work". 

I'll make further comments there.
