BUG TITLE:
[1.5][assist][enum] no override completion proposals in type when followed by a package visible enum

BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
I20050118 + 0120 ZRH plug-in export

I don't get any completion proposals in the following cu, with the caret at |.
Note that completion proposals *are* reported after the enum declaration, and
even within the enum declaration after the semicolon-terminated list of enums,
but never before.

--------- Completion.java ---------

package test1;

public class Completion {
	| // does not work here
}

enum Natural {
	ONE;
     // works here
}

class After {
    // works here
}
Within methods, completion works as expected. Only the method override proposals
do not work.
Completion works in first class when you comment enum:
public class Completion {
	| // works now here...
}

//enum Natural {
//	ONE;
     // works here
//}

class After {
    // works here
}
Fixed and test added
  EnumCompletionParserTest#test0001()

Inside Parser#consumeEnumConstantHeaderName identifierPtr was decreased before
the call to createFieldDeclaration() and cause an exception catched by
CompletionEngine.
