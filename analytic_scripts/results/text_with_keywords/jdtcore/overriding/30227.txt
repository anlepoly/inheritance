BUG REPORT COMMENTS:
Currently the jdt.core project has the file jdtCompilerAdapter.jar in the root. 
This file is a derived resource and should not be included in the repository.  
Under certain circumstances it can conflict with the build mechanism causing 
its recompilation to be skipped and the source and logs not be shipped 
properly.  Please remove as soon as possible.
Well for testing purpose we use it too. The original story was that it was 
overriden anyway.
Using it for testing is fine and removing it from the repo should not be a 
barrier.  The jar should be built by an externalToolsBuilder on your project 
when you load the project into your workspace.  For an example of how the other 
teams do this, see org.eclipse.core.resources.  

Not deriving it in this way can lead to inconsistencies when you change code 
that the jar uses but the jar is not recompiled/rebuilt.
Olivier - please do the necessary so as to get it recreated on a build action. 
I assume it only gets created if missing (during the build process).
